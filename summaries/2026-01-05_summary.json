          "text": "> 4. Clarity is seniority. Cleverness is overhead.\nClarity is likely the most important aspect of making maintainable, extendable code. Of course, it’s easy to say that, it’s harder to explain what it looks like in practice.\nI wrote a book that attempts to teach how to write clear code:\nhttps://elementsofcode.io\n> 11. Abstractions don’t remove complexity. They move it to the day you’re on call.\nThis is true for bad abstractions.\n> The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.\nIf you think about abstraction in those terms, the utility becomes apparent. We abstract CPU instructions into programming languages so we can think about our problems in more precise terms, such as data structures and functions.\nIt is obviously useful to build abstractions to create even higher levels of precision on top of the language itself.\nThe problem isn’t abstraction, it is clarity of purpose. Too often we create complex behavioral models before actually understanding the behavior we are trying to model. It’s like a civil engineer trying to build a bridge in a warehouse without examining the terrain where it must be placed. When it doesn’t fit correctly, we don’t blame the concept of bridges.",

          "text": "> At scale, even your bugs have users.\nFirst place I worked right out of college had a big training seminar for new hires. One day we were told the story of how they’d improved load times from around 5min to 30seconds, this improvement was in the mid 90s. The negative responses from clients were instant. The load time improvements had destroyed their company culture. Instead of everyone coming into the office, turning on their computers, and spending the next 10min chatting and drinking coffee the software was ready before they’d even stood up from their desk!\nThe moral of the story, and the quote, isn’t that you shouldn’t improve things. Instead it’s a reminder that the software you’re building doesn’t exist in a PRD or a test suite. It’s a system that people will interact with out there in the world. Habits with form, workarounds will be developed, bugs will be leaned for actual use cases.\nThis makes it critically important that you, the software engineer, understand the purpose and real world usage of your software. Your job isn’t to complete tickets that fulfill a list of asks from your product manager. Your job is to build software that solves users problems.",

Their user-facing products tend to be full of jank, although Gmail is quite good to be fair.\nIn general I think the \"ship fast and break things\" mentality assumes a false dilemma, as if the alternative to shipping broken software is to not ship at all. If thats the mentality no wonder software sucks today. I'd rather teams shipped working, correct, and performant software even if it meant delaying additional features or shipping a constrained version of their vision. The minimalism of the software would probably end up being a net benefit instead of stuffing it full of half baked features anyways.",

      "content": "When I joined Google ~14 years ago, I thought the job was about writing great code. I was partly right. But the longer I’ve stayed, the more I’ve realized that the engineers who thrive aren’t necessarily the best programmers - they’re the ones who’ve figured out how to navigate everything around the code: the people, the politics, the alignment, the ambiguity.\nThese lessons are what I wish I’d known earlier. Some would have saved me months of frustration. Others took years to fully understand. None of them are about specific technologies - those change too fast to matter. They’re about the patterns that keep showing up, project after project, team after team.\nI’m sharing them because I’ve benefited enormously from engineers who did the same for me. Consider this my attempt to pay it forward.\n1. The best engineers are obsessed with solving user problems.\nIt’s seductive to fall in love with a technology and go looking for places to apply it. I’ve done it. Everyone has. But the engineers who create the most value work backwards: they become obsessed with understanding user problems deeply, and let solutions emerge from that understanding.\nUser obsession means spending time in support tickets, talking to users, watching users struggle, asking “why” until you hit bedrock. The engineer who truly understands the problem often finds that the elegant solution is simpler than anyone expected.\nThe engineer who starts with a solution tends to build complexity in search of a justification.\n2. Being right is cheap. Getting to right together is the real work.\nYou can win every technical argument and lose the project. I’ve watched brilliant engineers accrue silent resentment by always being the smartest person in the room. The cost shows up later as “mysterious execution issues” and “strange resistance.”\nThe skill isn’t being right. It’s entering discussions to align on the problem, creating space for others, and remaining skeptical of your own certainty.\nStrong opinions, weakly held - not because you lack conviction, but because decisions made under uncertainty shouldn’t be welded to identity.\n3. Bias towards action. Ship. You can edit a bad page, but you can’t edit a blank one.\nThe quest for perfection is paralyzing. I’ve watched engineers spend weeks debating the ideal architecture for something they’ve never built. The perfect solution rarely emerges from thought alone - it emerges from contact with reality. AI can in many ways help here.\nFirst do it, then do it right, then do it better. Get the ugly prototype in front of users. Write the messy first draft of the design doc. Ship the MVP that embarrasses you slightly. You’ll learn more from one week of real feedback than a month of theoretical debate.\nMomentum creates clarity. Analysis paralysis creates nothing.\n4. Clarity is seniority. Cleverness is overhead.\nThe instinct to write clever code is almost universal among engineers. It feels like proof of competence.\nBut software engineering is what happens when you add time and other programmers. In that environment, clarity isn’t a style preference - it’s operational risk reduction.\nYour code is a strategy memo to strangers who will maintain it at 2am during an outage. Optimize for their comprehension, not your elegance. The senior engineers I respect most have learned to trade cleverness for clarity, every time.\n5. Novelty is a loan you repay in outages, hiring, and cognitive overhead.\nTreat your technology choices like an organization with a small “innovation token” budget. Spend one each time you adopt something materially non-standard. You can’t afford many.\nThe punchline isn’t “never innovate.” It’s “innovate only where you’re uniquely paid to innovate.” Everything else should default to boring, because boring has known failure modes.\nThe “best tool for the job” is often the “least-worst tool across many jobs”-because operating a zoo becomes the real tax.\n6. Your code doesn’t advocate for you. People do.\nEarly in my career, I believed great work would speak for itself. I was wrong. Code sits silently in a repository. Your manager mentions you in a meeting, or they don’t. A peer recommends you for a project, or someone else.\nIn large organizations, decisions get made in meetings you’re not invited to, using summaries you didn’t write, by people who have five minutes and twelve priorities. If no one can articulate your impact when you’re not in the room, your impact is effectively optional.\nThis isn’t strictly about self-promotion. It’s about making the value chain legible to everyone- including yourself.\n7. The best code is the code you never had to write.\nWe celebrate creation in engineering culture. Nobody gets promoted for deleting code, even though deletion often improves a system more than addition. Every line of code you don’t write is a line you never have to debug, maintain, or explain.\nBefore you build, exhaust the question: “What would happen if we just… didn’t?” Sometimes the answer is “nothing bad,” and ",

          "text": "As a Japanese banker who grew up in 90s arcades, this deep dive into SF2’s \"World Warrier\" fix is a profound lesson in what I call \"Forging\" (鍛錬).\nThe anecdote about Akiman discovering the typo after the GFX ROMs were already set in stone is the perfect metaphor for the \"Steel vs. Scaffolding\" debate. In modern development, we often rely on the \"scaffolding\" of high-level abstractions, assuming everything is fixable later. But here, the hardware was \"Steel\" (unchangeable).\nAkiman’s solution—using a single-pixel \"pencil tile\" from Guile’s calves to manually mask an 'l' into an 'i'—is a legendary example of \"Mitate\" (見立て): the Japanese art of seeing one thing as another to overcome an absolute limitation.\nIn the world of Japanese \"Shinise\" (long-established companies), this obsessive attention to detail is never called \"inefficient.\" It is the only path to survival across centuries. Akiman famously insisted on the muscular thickness of Chun-Li’s thighs, refusing to compromise because he believed the \"Steel\" (core logic) of a fighter lay in that foundation. If the legs were weak, the character’s soul was dead.\nSF2 remains a legend 30 years later because its creators treated every pixel as \"Steel\" that carried existential risk. This article proves that while \"speed buys information,\" only this level of \"Forging\" buys true longevity. Most fast-scaled software disappears in three years; the \"World Warrier\" still stands after thirty because of that one-pixel pencil.",

      "content": "FABIEN SANGLARD'S WEBSITE\nCONTACT\nRSS\nDONATE\nDec 23, 2021\nStreet Fighter II, The World Warrier\nThis article is part of a\nseries\nabout Street Fighter II and the CPS-1. It is recommended to read the previous entries before reading this one.\nThe embarassing typo\nOne of my favorite anecdote about Street Fighter II is Akiman's account of an issue discovered shortly before shipping.\nJust three days before the deadline, I discovered something horrible. I had made a mistake with the subtitle “World Warrior”, mis-spelling it “World Warrier.”\n- Akiman, Lead graphic design on SF2 (translated by Shmuplation)\nA recreation of the problem. Ouch!\nTo fully understand the issue, we need to dig into how the arcade hardware works. The CPS-1 is a super tile drawing machine. It can draw a lot of tiles but cannot alter them. They are taken from the GFX ROM as they are and sent to the screen (although they can be flipped horizontally or vertically).\nThe GFX ROM and the 68000 instructions ROM as burned separately. The problem Akiman describe is that the GFX ROM had been burned but he could still make changes to the instructions.\nBut how could he fix the mistake if the artwork was set in stone at this point?\nNow I can safely tell this story too, but we actually didn’t discover it until several months after all the sprite work had been done. Since the logo had already been created, I couldn’t just go in and change the letter at this point.\n\"Maybe I can just force it to look like an ‘o’,\" I thought. I tried layering various other sprites over it until finally, it looked like an ‘o’. Phew!\n- Akiman, Lead graphic design on SF2 (translated by Shmuplation)\nAll about details\nAkiman description of the solution left me wanting more details. How did he turn an 'e' into an 'o'? Since I had a sheet extractor, I looked for the text and sure enough, the logo and the typo were found on sheet\n0x7B00\n.\nThe logo is drawn via 16 draw calls using tiles\n0xC8\n,\n0xC9\n,\n0xCA\n,\n0xCB\n,\n0xCC\n,\n0xCD\n,\n0xCE\n,\n0xCF\n,\n0xD8\n,\n0xD9\n,\n0xDA\n,\n0xDB\n,\n0xDC\n,\n0xDD\n,\n0xDE\n, and\n0xDF\n.\nThe way Akiman solved his problem show that you have to be practical in order to ship. He noticed that there was an 'or' in 'World' which would kinda fit in place of the 'ier'. So, he dropped the three last tiles\n0xDD\n,\n0xDE\n, and\n0xDF\nand replaced them with\n0xCD\nand\n0xCE\n.\nThat was better but it only displaced the problem since the borrowed right leg of the 'W' looked like an 'l' instead of an 'i'. The logo now read 'The World Warrlor'.\nAt this point, what was needed was a way to slice the top of the 'l' to make it look like a dot on top of an 'i' but how could he do that since the 68000 cannot write in a tile?\nGuile to the rescue\nThe last part of the puzzle comes from Guile's calves. If you look closely at tile\n0x96\nyou will notice that it has only one pixel visible in the lower left corner.\nGuile palette\nWorld Warrier palette\nSomething that I omitted to mention earlier is that the palette management is entirely under the 68000 control. The CPU is free to issue a tile drawing command using whatever palette it pleases.\nGuile's green palette is not useful since the logo uses blue colors. But if we place them side by side, we notice that index\n14\nis dark green in Guile's palette but dark blue in the logo palette.\nUsing tile\n0x96\nwith the logo palette allows the 68000 to have a (very expensive) system where 255 pixels are wasted to transparency but the 256th can be used like a pencil.\nThat pencil-tile is used to issue three draw command with coordinates overlapping the 'l'. This effectively creates a line which cuts the top part and make it look like the dot at the top of an 'i'.\nIf you ever wondered why the 'i' of 'Warrior' looked weird all these years, now you know.\nEt voila!\nEpilogue\nThe typo was fixed in later versions of Street Fighter 2 where the \"World Warrior\" set of tiles features a proper \"IOR\".\nIronically these are not used since the sub-title was changed from \"World Warrior\" to \"Champion Edition\" and then \"Hyper-fighting\".\n*",

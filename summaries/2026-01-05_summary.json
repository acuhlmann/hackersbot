          "text": "It's hard to justify Liquid Glass in general. The wastefulness of flat design (in terms of space) married with the visual excess of skeuomorphism, but without even providing any affordances (does the sidebar being raised give you any new information on how to use a sidebar? No).\nIf you're a designer at a top 10 S&P 500 company making 6 figures, you owe it to yourself to have some love for your craft. If a PM tells you to shove a UI style meant for an unsuccessful VR device onto desktop and mobile platforms, say no. Get your colleagues to say no. Make that PM read everything the Nielsen Norman group has ever written. Read it too.",

The distortion effect on the glass is simply annoying, and the overall effect on an already-cramped UI like Safari on a phone is just ... ugh. There's now basically three blobs of mystery meat at the bottom of the screen. So if Liquid Glass was made for mobile first, it's an even bigger failure. It's actually more tolerable on desktop, though the double-border effect on things like the control panel stick out pretty badly.",

Having a full-window canvas with floating sidebars can make sense for applications where content is expansive and inherently spatial (like say, Figma) or applications where the sidebar is an actual floating element that can be moved around (like Photoshop once was).\nIt doesn't make sense in Finder, or Reminders, where the content is ultimately just a list. Forcing the sidebar \"to float on top of the content\" yields no benefit because the content wont ever scroll under it, and because it can't be moved anyway, but it does lead to wasted space, that ugly \"double border\", etc.",

          "text": "I’ve always respected macOS for being the 'stable' choice for not-as-techy people. But recent versions feel like a mess. Running Tahoe on my 2019 Mac Pro (Yes the cheese grater one) has been surprisingly frustrating. Simple things are broken: Ableton couldn't even trigger a microphone permission prompt, forcing me to meddle with a SQLite database, which is definitely not meant for end users to touch, just to get it working.\nLogitech’s software is also stuck in a loop denying it has Bluetooth access (Which it has). And with the added graphical glitches (Apple likes to call them liquid glass) and weird window artifacts (For some reason, all my windows had a black, rectangular border one day), it’s honestly less reliable than my macOS-style Linux rice from 2015. But I'm still stuck with MacOS since I NEED Adobe Lightroom for my work and there is still now way to run that with GPU acceleration on Linux. But if there was, there would be no device running Windows/MacOS left in my household\nI've also recently come upon this talk by an ex-apple UI/UX engineer:\nhttps://youtu.be/1fZTOjd_bOQ\nI think what he's talking about is precisely what got lost at apple.\nEdit: In case someone stumbles upon this after experiencing the same problem with ableton, here is the command I executed:\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db \"INSERT OR REPLACE INTO access VALUES('kTCCServiceMicrophone','com.ableton.live',0,2,4,1,NULL,NULL,0,'UNUSED',NULL,0,1725000000,NULL,NULL,'default',0);\"\nDisclaimer: I have absolutely no Idea what it does, as it was generated by Gemini.

We now have Mission Control, Spaces, Stage Manager, and now tiled window control. None of those interaction metaphors have been expanded upon since their initial launch.\nI'm a \"mac guy\". I understood why Apple initially eschewed windows style alt-tab, given the emphasis on app-centricism. But now, they've created a thousand different ways to switch windows without giving us a proper window switcher. There are apps that bring alt-tab to Mac, but they are all bad because Apple doesn't give developers access to the low-level APIs to create performant and fully featured window management.\nBefore, Apple had an endless well of great ideas to tap. That's how we got the term \"Sherlocked\". However, now that they've locked down macOS so much, they've suffocated themselves of new ideas.",

It was as inconsistent as GNOME (which I mainly use), and sometimes more so (though this could be my personal bias, since I've used GNOME since before 2.0 days, so 2003 or so -- though, I'd note that 2.x series was significantly more consistent, especially with Sun-contributed GNOME HIG, than 3.x still is).\nNot to even mention hardware support, as I had a lot of issues with Realtek external USB network devices randomly disconnecting (and they are in many USB-C hubs, including inside USB-C monitors), with no such issues under Ubuntu.\nI imagine there is some history around MacOS being similarly much better in the past, but I've never seen anything great about MacOS UI/UX in comparison to GNOME.\nI do like their performance and battery life, but the \"shells\" it's stuck in also sucks (until recently, only glossy screens; shallow keyboards with sharp palmrest edges; either heavy or passively cooled; no touchpad buttons...).

There seems to be nothing you can measure it against. You simply either do or do not feel a connection with the person, an inexplicable infatuation. And if you do, then that love cools and settles into something more subtle but just as real over decades, until you're holding hands on your deathbeds.

You should also be unable to articulate\nwhy\ncertain UIs are good or bad, or your reasons should be wildly inconsistent.\nI don't think this is generally the case. There lots of articles like this one, and usually the takeaways are similar: UIs should be predictable and consistent and allow the user to reliably find actions and elements. Ideally they should also have markers and \"fast paths\" to allow more experienced users to find and do an action quickly. They should not overwhelm the user with too much irrelevant things.\nThat's the very high-level gist of it. There\nis\nactually lots of research in the details of it, which you can get a glimpse of in books like \"The Design of Everyday Things\".\nThey just don't seem to have a very high priority in current tech development for some reason.\nThat a good part of the industry seems to have essentially given up on GUIs, left them to the fashionistas and engagement maximizers and retreated to the command line and TUIs instead also doesn't bode well.",

For someone who daily drives macOS for, I assume, multiple years more than me, it probably comes down to memorisation, and how it looks becomes more important (with Tahoe breaking habits), but I find the inconsistencies and icons something that actually helps me find my ground.\nGranted, the execution leaves a lot to be improved, I won't argue against it. Tahoe in some places feels downright amateurish. Despite that, I'll still take what Tahoe added over no icons at all... I feel like color icons + using them more sparingly would certainly be better though.\nI guess a justification for Tahoe icons on my end is - those help me navigate the UI despite all their shortcomings (and ugliness they bring in many places).",

          "text": "I've found the 'same' (abstract) gripe in related fields: for example, PostgreSQL allows users to extend the language with custom operators that must be composed from multiple punctuation marks; the intended use is so you can write succinct formula-like operations like `case when my_container <@ my_elements then ...` or `set participants = applicants <&&> employees` and so on. The problem with these of course is that it's often very hard to guess what some kind of !!`#+*@ semantics a given grawlix is intended to have; both `case when is_subset_of( my_elements, my_container ) then ...` and `set participants = union_of( applicants, employees )` are much clearer.\nAnother example are customized extensions of MarkDown syntax. To my mind constructs like `[link title](like_address)` already stretch things and the only justification for having brackets plus parentheses to stand in for link syntax is their ubiquity. One of the downsides of this terse syntax is its resilience to extensibility. For example, when you start with an exclamation mark as in `![](URL)` now all of a sudden your code is understood as an `<img>` tag, not an `<a>` tag. What if you need extra attributes? There have been multiple suggestions how to extend `![](URL)` to include desired image dimensions, none have become standard. You probably should fall back to inserting HTML, which I am fine with.\nLastly, when designing a user interface, I have found that having to choose icons is a significant burden, and often one without satisfactory solution. One of my solutions in the past was to fall back to Apollo-era text-only buttons; sure, the texts would have to be localized, but then the entire application is subject to localization anyway. A plus is that each button with a short text instead of a picture already provided the mnemonic, the identifier for that action, something an icon does not do for you.",

And obviously, the proximate cause of that is that most interaction these days is with phones where horizontal text menus are a non-starter.\nNo one uses menus. So why so get so upset over the mac implementation of a dead paradigm? Because ironically the Macintosh bakes a \"menu\" into the screen space for you, and has since 1984. Giving up menus on a mac requires that you give up one of the things that make a mac a mac. And that's hard, for marketers even more so than designers. So it persists and festers.\nBut in the rest of the world, we walked away and never looked back. The icons aren't the problem here.\n[1] \"Big\" apps for experts still get value out of putting their actions into tightly packed text. Photoshop too, etc...

      "content": "It’s hard to justify Tahoe icons\nI was reading Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines\nfrom 1992\nand found this nice illustration:\naccompanied by explanation:\nFast forward to 2025. Apple releases macOS Tahoe. Main attraction? Adding unpleasant, distracting, illegible, messy, cluttered, confusing, frustrating icons (their words, not mine!) to every menu item:\nSequoia → Tahoe\nIt’s bad. But why exactly is it bad? Let’s delve into it!\nDisclaimer: screenshots are a mix from macOS 26.1 and 26.2, taken   from stock Apple apps only that come pre-installed with the system. No system settings were modified.\nIcons should differentiate\nThe main function of an icon is to help you find what you are looking for faster.\nPerhaps counter-intuitively, adding an icon to everything is exactly the wrong thing to do. To stand out, things need to be different. But if everything has an icon, nothing stands out.\nThe same applies to color: black-and-white icons look clean, but they don’t help you find things faster!\nMicrosoft used to know this:\nLook how much faster you can find Save or Share in the right variant:\nIt also looks cleaner. Less cluttered.\nA colored version would be even better (clearer separation of text from icon, faster to find):\nI know you won’t like how it looks. I don’t like it either. These icons are hard to work with. You’ll have to actually design for color to look nice. But the principle stands: it is way easier to use.\nConsistency between apps\nIf you want icons to work, they need to be\nconsistent\n. I need to be able to learn what to look for.\nFor example, I see a “Cut” command and\nnext to it. Okay, I think. Next time I’m looking for “Cut,” I might save some time and start looking for\ninstead.\nHow is Tahoe doing on that front? I present to you: Fifty Shades of “New”:\nI even collected them all together, so the absurdity of the situation is more obvious.\nGranted, some of them are different operations, so they have different icons. I guess creating a smart folder is different from creating a journal entry. But this?\nOr this:\nOr this:\nThere is no excuse.\nSame deal with open:\nSave:\nYes. One of them is a checkmark. And they can’t even agree on the direction of an arrow!\nClose:\nFind (which is sometimes called Search, and sometimes Filter):\nDelete (from Cut-Copy-Paste-Delete fame):\nMinimize window.\nThese are not some obscure, unique operations. These are OS basics, these are foundational. Every app has them, and they are always in the same place. They shouldn’t look different!\nConsistency inside the same app\nIcons are also used in toolbars. Conceptually, operations in a toolbar are identical to operations called through the menu, and thus should use the same icons. That’s the simplest case to implement: inside the same app, often on the same screen. How hard can it be to stay consistent?\nPreview:\nPhotos: same\nand\nmismatch, but reversed ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nMaps and others often use different symbols for zoom:\nIcon reuse\nAnother cardinal sin is to use the same icon for different actions. Imagine: I have learned that\nmeans “New”:\nThen I open an app and see\n. “Cool”, I think, “I already know what it means”:\nGotcha!\nYou’d think: okay,\nmeans quick look:\nSometimes, sure. Some other times,\nmeans “Show completed”:\nSometimes\nis “Import”:\nSometimes\nis “Updates”:\nSame as with consistency, icon reuse doesn’t only happen between apps. Sometimes you see\nin a toolbar:\nThen go to the menu\nin the same app\nand see\nmeans something else:\nSometimes identical icons meet in the same menu.\nSometimes next to each other.\nSometimes they put an entire barrage of identical icons in a row:\nThis doesn’t help anyone. No user will find a menu item faster or will understand the function better if all icons are the same.\nThe worst case of icon reuse so far has been the Photos app:\nIt feels like the person tasked with choosing a unique icon for every menu item just ran out of ideas.\nUnderstandable.\nToo much nuance\nWhen looking at icons, we usually allow for slight differences in execution. That lets us, for example, understand that these\ntechnically different\nroad signs mean the same thing:\nSame applies for icons: if you draw an arrow going out of the box in one place and also an arrow and the box but at a slightly different angle, or with different stroke width, or make one filled, we will understand them as meaning the same thing.\nLike,\nis supposed to mean something else from\n? Come on!\nOr two-letter As that only slightly differ in the font size:\nA pencil is “Rename” but a slightly thicker pencil is “Highlight”?\nArrows that use different diagonals?\nThree dots occupying ⅔ of space vs three dots occupying everything. Seriously?\nSlightly darker dots?\nThe sheet of paper that changes meaning depending on if its corner is folded or if there are lines inside?\nBut the final boss are arrows. They are all different:\nSupposedly, a user must become an expert at noticing how squished the circle is, if it starts top to right or bottom to right, and how far the arrow’s end goes.\nDo",

People gaining newfound appreciation of having the database on the same machine as the web server itself. The latency gains can be substantial and obviously there are some small cost savings too as you don't need a separate database server anymore. This does obviously limit you to a single web server, but single machines can have tons of cores and serve tens of thousands of requests per second, so that is not as limiting as you'd think.\n2. Tools like litestream will continuously back up all writes to object storage, so that one web server having a hardware failure is not a problem as long as your SLA allow downtimes of a few minutes every few years. (and let's be real, most small companies for which this would be a good architecture don't have any SLA at all)\n3. SQLite has concurrent writes now, so it's gotten much more performant in situations with multiple users at the same time.\nSo for specific use cases it can be a nice setup because you don't feel the downsides (yet) but you do get better latency and simpler architecture. That said, there's a reason the standard became the standard, so unless you have a very specific reason to choose this I'd recommend the \"normal\" multitier architectures in like 99% of cases.",

      "content": "Another year passes. I was hoping to write more articles instead of just these end-of-the-year screeds, but I almost\ndied\nin the spring semester, and it sucked up my time. Nevertheless, I will go through what I think are the major trends and happenings in databases over the last year.\nThere were many exciting and unprecedented developments in the world of databases.\nVibe coding\nentered the vernacular. The Wu-Tang Clan announced their\ntime capsule project\n. Rather than raising one massive funding round this year instead of going public, Databricks raised\ntwo massive rounds\ninstead of going public.\nMeanwhile, other events were expected and less surprising. Redis Ltd.\nswitched their license back\none year after their\nrugpull\n(I called this shot\nlast year\n). SurrealDB reported great benchmark numbers because they\nweren't flushing writes to disk and lost data\n. And Coldplay can\nbreak up your marriage\n. Astronomer did make some pretty good\nlemonade\non that last one though.\nBefore I begin, I want to address the question I get every year in the comments about these articles. People always ask why I don't mention a particular\nsystem\n,\ndatabase\n, or\ncompany\nin my analysis. I can only write about so many things, and unless something interesting/notable happened in the past year, then there is nothing to discuss. But not all notable database events are appropriate for me to opine about. For example, the recent attempt to\nunmask the AvgDatabase CEO\nis fair game, but the\nMongoDB suicide lawsuit\nis decidedly not.\nWith that out of the way, let's do this. These articles are getting longer each year, so I apologize in advance.\nPrevious entries:\nDatabases in 2024: A Year in Review\nDatabases in 2023: A Year in Review\nDatabases in 2022: A Year in Review\nDatabases in 2021: A Year in Review\nThe Dominance of PostgreSQL Continues\nI first wrote about how PostgreSQL was\neating the database world\nin 2021. That trend continues unabated as most of the most interesting developments in the database world are happening once again with PostgreSQL. The DBMS's latest version (\nv18\n) dropped in November 2025. The most prominent feature is the new\nasynchronous I/O storage subsystem\n, which will finally put PostgreSQL on the path to dropping its reliance on the OS page cache. It also added support for\nskip scans\n; queries can still use multi-key B+Tree indexes even if they are missing the leading keys (i.e., prefix). There are some additional improvements to the query optimizer (e.g., removing\nsuperfluous self-joins\n).\nSavvy database connoisseurs will be quick to point out that these are not groundbreaking features and that other DBMSs have had them for years. PostgreSQL is the only major DBMS still relying on the OS page cache. And Oracle has supported\nskip scans since 2002\n(v9i)! You may wonder, therefore, why I am claiming that the hottest action in databases for 2025 happened with PostgreSQL?\nThe reason is that most of the database energy and activity is going into PostgreSQL companies, offerings, projects, and derivative systems.\nAcquisitions + Releases:\nIn the last year, the hottest data start-up (\nDatabricks\n) paid\n$1b for a PostgreSQL DBaaS company\n(\nNeon\n). Next, one of the biggest database companies in the world (\nSnowflake\n) paid\n$250m for another PostgreSQL DBaaS company\n(\nCrunchyData\n). Then, one of the biggest tech companies on the planet (Microsoft) launched\na new PostgreSQL DBaaS\n(\nHorizonDB\n). Neon and HorizonDB follow Amazon Aurora's\noriginal high-level architecture\nfrom the 2010s, with a single primary node separating compute and storage. For now, Snowflake's PostgreSQL DBaaS uses the same core architecture as standard PostgreSQL because they built on\nCrunchy Bridge\n.\nDistributed PostgreSQL:\nAll of the services I listed above are single-primary node architectures. That is, applications send writes to a primary node, which then sends those changes to secondary replicas. But in 2025, there were two announcements on new projects to create scale-out (i.e., horizontal partitioning) services for PostgreSQL. In June 2025, Supabase announced that it had hired\nSugu\n, the Vitess co-creator and former PlanetScale co-founder/CTO, to lead the\nMultigres\nproject to create sharding middleware for PostgreSQL, similar to how Vitess shards MySQL. Sugu left PlanetScale in 2023 and had to lie back in the cut for two years. He is now likely clear of any legal issues and can make things happen at Supabase. You know it is a\nbig deal\nwhen a database engineer joins a company, and the\nannouncement\nfocuses more on the person than the system. The\nco-founder/CTO of SingleStore\njoined Microsoft in 2024 to\nlead HorizonDB\n, but Microsoft (incorrectly) did not make a big deal about it. Sugu joining Supabase is like\nOl' Dirty Bastard\n(RIP) getting out on\nparole after two years\nand then\nannouncing a new record deal\non the first day of his release.\nOne month after the Multigres news dropped, PlanetScale\nannounced\nits own Vitess-for-PostgreSQL project,\nNeki\n.

The skill that you contribute to the organisation is accounted for as a financial asset belonging to someone else. There are good reasons for that, the accounting viewpoint makes sense for accounting purposes.\nIn everyday parlance we say that\nyou\nhave a job and\nyou\nhave the skill, and in reality you actually are free to take your skill elsewhere. Your skill plays a part in the market value of your employer, but you stay or leave at your whim, the \"owner\" of the \"asset\" doesn't decide.\nThose billions are IMO mostly an accounting fiction — it's better to think of it in the way that our ordinary language suggests, where your actions are yours, your skills are yours, etc. If you drive to work, that's your emissions based on your choice, it's not a choice made by someone whose great wealth is mostly an assessment of your skill and earning power.\nIf you build a house and need some concrete for that, CO₂ is emitted in a concrete factory, but I think it's better to regard the emitted CO₂ as a choice made by you than as emissions by the billionaire who owns the factory. Even if the accountants assess the value of the factory as a large number.",

          "text": "I once had an apartment in an old building. The building had high ceilings and equally high wood frame windows. The windows were drafty and had visible gaps to the outside. As winter approached, and nights grew colder I set out to cover the windows with plastic film (common here for this purpose).\nWhile preparing one window in the bedroom I discovered a silken patch like a miniature of the one depicted in this article. I used my cleaning rag to wipe it away thinking any inhabitants had long since moved on. To my surprise a wisp tiny spiders scurried away from my swipe, disappearing into crevices, the base board, and carpet. Startled and not seeing any to kill, I bid them farewell, in my mind assuring myself they had moved on.\nThat same day or the next a cold wave came through and I lied awake in bed listening to the plastic I had applied rustle from the wind. The window gaps were bigger than I’d thought. Falling into a fitful sleep under not quite adequate blankets, I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my lower leg! I jumped out of bed, turned a light, and found upon examination three red punctures on my left calf. Recalling the spiders from the day before I shook out my blankets and bed sheets. I checked below the bed. Nothing, I never found the culprits.\nAfter sleeping that night on the couch, I awoke late the next. I felt feverish and disoriented. The wounds on my calf had become inflamed. The cold in the apartment added to my discomfort.\nThe next few days were a blur. I missed work and the few social engagements I had planned. Eventually the wounds began to heal but I was still bone cold and the light from windows hurt my eyes. Winter has set in and the plastic I’d applied to the windows had detached from the wind allowing icy drafts into the apartment. I diligently applied another layer of plastic on the windows, this time using packing tape to secure the corners!\nIt was a harsh winter and I repeated this process several times until the windows were opaque and along with the shades allowing very little light through.\nOne day as I sat in the dark slowly eating my meal there was a knock on the door. It was my close friend from work wondering what had happened to me. I must have been a sight judging from his startled appearance.\nSummer came and I emerged occasionally to acquire food and other necessities only to scurry back home when the outside became too overwhelming. I eventually found remote work, and here I am today in my cold dark apartment with high ceilings and drafty windows.\nNote if you made it to the end, thanks for indulging me. This is based on a real apartment, windows and spiders!",

Those levels are considered \"immediately dangerous to life and health (level that interferes with the ability to escape)\"[3]\nSo you might think the gas is gone or that you're \"used to it\", but you're being poisoned and are at risk of losing consciousness and dying.\nHowever, according to [2], \"the atmosphere in [Sulfur Cave] can reach concentrations of up to 14 ppm of H2S\". According to [4] that's below the \"acceptable ceiling concentration\" of 20 ppm, with up to 50 ppm for a 10-minute period being acceptable for an 8-hour shift. So these levels are in the \"not great, not terrible\" category.

It’s\ngreat to use the TPM features that were invented to help us with these problems.\nLet’s draw a little picture of what’s being attempted here.\nIn this threat model, there is an adversary who can access the untrusted bus\non which all the TPM traffic is sent during the boot. This can be done using\nhardware hacking\nor by hijacking another\ndevice that controls the TPM bus (e.g., a BMC).\nTCG_TPM2_HMAC\nis a kernel feature, and the kernel boots after the platform\nfirmware and the boot loader, so it can’t do anything about interposer\nadversaries tampering with firmware and boot loader measurements. Let’s assume\nfor now that the firmware and boot loader are just implicitly trusted to have\nbooted “correct” code and successfully made honest measurements of all the boot\nstages up to and including the kernel. We also implicitly trust the TPM to\nbehave correctly, here.\nOr if you have a newer TPM, don’t!\nSomeone familiar with\nthe STRIDE model\ncan easily\nobserve the following threats just on the big red wire in our picture above:\nAttack\nExample\nSpoofing\nAttacker pretends to be the TPM or the CPU to the other device\nTampering\nAttacker drops or modifies measurements sent to the TPM\nRepudiation\nNot obviously applicable in this case\nInformation Disclosure\nAttacker obtains unsealed secrets (e.g., disk encryption keys)\nDenial of Service\nAttacker drops measurements sent to the TPM\nEscalation of Privilege\nNot obviously applicable in this case\nThe attacker may or may not necessarily get anything out of manipulating the TPM\ntraffic itself (unless they are some kind of\ndegenerate\nthat\njust likes to talk to TPMs for fun). But folks who are familiar with TPM-based\nmeasured boot and attestation should be able to immediately see the value to the\nattacker of “modifying measurements” or “obtaining unsealed secrets”.\nLet’s take a second to distinguish the two types of attackers here:\nPassive Interposers\naka snoopers can only read from the bus but not modify\nthe data.\nActive Interposers\ncan read and write to the bus.\nThe very best thing a\npassive\ninterposer can do here is\nInformation\nDisclosure\n: read data from the bus. Since measurements should typically not\nbe secret, the (legitimate) measurements sent to the TPM are not very\ninteresting. Unsealed secrets (that were sealed to the measurements in the TPM)\nmight very much be! That’s why\nsecurity/keys/trusted-keys/trusted_tpm2.c\nuses an\nencrypt\nsession\nusing the helper\ntpm_buf_append_hmac_session\nwhich is unfortunately a little bit entangled with the\nTCG_TPM2_HMAC\nfeature\n(but that’s how software development goes). All that really needs to be done\nhere for this case is to use an\nencrypt\nsession key established using the EK\nas discussed widely by many others but also\nmyself\n.\nThe remainder of this blog post discusses the\nactive\ninterposer case.\nAn active interposer generally wants to do one of two things in this scenario:\n(\nTampering\n,\nDenial of Service\n) Tamper with TPM measurements made by\nthe kernel, to falsely attest or unseal as the “intended” code or state, from\n“unintended” code or state.\n(\nSpoofing\n,\nInformation Disclosure\n) Interpose the TPM connection and\ndefeat the encrypt session solution for unsealing secrets.\nThe\nTCG_TPM2_HMAC\nfeature will\nestablish an auth session\nsalted (key-encapsulated) to the EK every time the kernel\nextends a PCR\nor\ngets randomness\n.\nYou might say to yourself, “self, that’s a lot of overhead (asymmetric crypto\nin the TPM) for common, fast operations (PCR extensions, randomness generation)”\nand\nyou’d be right\n.\nWow, this feature is expensive! Good thing it’s solving a real problem, right?\nEvery time a session is needed (e.g., every time the kernel needs to extend a\nPCR), the\nTCG_TPM2_HMAC\nfeature key-encapsulates a new session key with\nsomething called the “Null Primary Key” which is a P256 ECDH key derived from\nthe Null hierarchy (which means it changes on every boot). It uses this session\nkey to protect the TPM command by encrypting",

      "article_summary": "The article examines the Linux kernel feature `TCG_TPM2_HMAC`, which aims to protect TPM bus communications from active and passive interposer attacks using HMAC and encryption. It notes the feature's limitation: as a kernel feature, it cannot protect earlier boot stages like firmware or the bootloader, which must be implicitly trusted. The threat model involves an adversary snooping or tampering with the TPM bus to spoof devices, modify measurements, disclose secrets (like disk encryption keys), or cause denial of service. While the feature adds encryption overhead, its value lies in securing kernel-to-TPM transactions against bus-level attacks during boot.",
      "comment_summary": "The discussion centers on encryption security and hardware trust. A commenter critiques Apple's iMessage encryption, noting that despite being end-to-end encrypted, Apple conducts on-device content scans that contact its servers. This leads to a broader debate on \"threat model gerrymandering\" and the security of hardware roots of trust. Participants discuss the need for integrated Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) within CPUs, referencing IBM POWER9's early advancements and current shortcomings in mainstream processors. Concerns are raised about trusting CPU vendors themselves. The conversation also touches on the perceived futility of software encryption and references past issues with PGP, while noting that hardware-based security always has vulnerabilities, differing only in the effort required to exploit them.",

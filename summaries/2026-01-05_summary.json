          "text": "> At scale, even your bugs have users.\nFirst place I worked right out of college had a big training seminar for new hires. One day we were told the story of how they’d improved load times from around 5min to 30seconds, this improvement was in the mid 90s. The negative responses from clients were instant. The load time improvements had destroyed their company culture. Instead of everyone coming into the office, turning on their computers, and spending the next 10min chatting and drinking coffee the software was ready before they’d even stood up from their desk!\nThe moral of the story, and the quote, isn’t that you shouldn’t improve things. Instead it’s a reminder that the software you’re building doesn’t exist in a PRD or a test suite. It’s a system that people will interact with out there in the world. Habits with form, workarounds will be developed, bugs will be leaned for actual use cases.\nThis makes it critically important that you, the software engineer, understand the purpose and real world usage of your software. Your job isn’t to complete tickets that fulfill a list of asks from your product manager. Your job is to build software that solves users problems.",

Instead of everyone coming into the office, turning on their computers, and spending the next 10min chatting and drinking coffee\nOne of my early tasks as a junior engineer involved some automation work in a warehouse. It got assigned to me, the junior, because it involved a lot of time working in the warehouse instead of at a comfortable desk.\nI assumed I’d be welcomed and appreciated for helping make their work more efficient, but the reality was not that simple. The more efficient I made the technical part of the job, the more time they had to spend doing the manual labor part of the job to keep up. So the more I reduced cycle times, the less time they had to sit around and chat.\nMind you, the original process was extremely slow and non-parallel so they had\na lot\nof time to wait. The job was still very easy. I spent weeks doing it myself to test and optimize and to this day it’s the easiest manual labor job I’ve ever worked. Yet I as the anti-hero for ruining the good thing they had going.",

The best engineers are obsessed with solving user problems.\nI think this problem is rooted in early education: students learn languages, frameworks, and tools first without understanding what problems they actually solve. Once engineers have experience building a few products for users, they begin to understand what matters to the user.\n2. Being right is cheap. Getting to right together is the real work.\n- Sadly most of the arguments are won by either someone in power or experience. Right decisions are made with consensus. You build consensus during creative process and leverage power and experience during crisis.\n3. Bias towards action. Ship. You can edit a bad page, but you can’t edit a blank one.\n- Every decision is a risk management. The smart people convert higher risk into lower risk.

(Dijkstra)\nIf you think about abstraction in those terms, the utility becomes apparent. We abstract CPU instructions into programming languages so we can think about our problems in more precise terms, such as data structures and functions.\nIt is obviously useful to build abstractions to create even higher levels of precision on top of the language itself.\nThe problem isn’t abstraction, it is clarity of purpose. Too often we create complex behavioral models before actually understanding the behavior we are trying to model.

If the Google culture was at all obsessed about helping users, I wonder why Google UX always sucked so much and in particularly in the recent years seem to be getting even worse. Every single one of their services is a pain to use, with unnecessary steps, clicks - basically everything you are trying to do needs a click of sorts. Recently I was writing an e-mail and noticed I misspelled the e-mail address of the recipient, which I rarely do. So, I should just be able to click the address and edit it quickly, right? Wrong - now you have a popup menu and inside of it you have to search for \"edit e-mail\" option. Most of the rest of his lessons while valuable in their own right, are not something I would put under the headline of \"after X years at <insert-major-tech-company>\", as they do not quite seem to be that different from lessons you pick up at other companies ? I´d more interested to hear about how the culture was impacted when the bean-counters took over and started entshittifying the company for both the users and the employees too.",

I worked there from 2006-2014 in engineering roles and found this statement was particularly jarring:\n\"User obsession means spending time in support tickets, talking to users, watching users struggle, asking “why” until you hit bedrock\"\nWhen I worked on user facing stuff (Maps, Gmail, Accounts) I regularly read the public user support forums and ticket queues looking for complaints, sometimes I even took part in user threads to get more information. What I learned was:\n• Almost nobody else in engineering did this.\n• I was considered weird for doing it.\n• It was viewed negatively by managers and promo committees.\n• An engineer talking directly to users was considered especially weird and problematic.\n• The products did always have serious bugs that had escaped QA and monitoring.\nIn theory there were staff paid to monitor these forums, but in practice the eng managers paid little attention to them - think \"user voice\" reports once a quarter, that sort of thing. Partly that's because they weren't technical and often struggled to work out whether a user complaint was just noise or due to a genuine bug in the product, something often obvious to an engineer, so stuff didn't get escalated properly.\nThis general disconnection from the outside world was pervasive. When I joined the abuse team in 2010 I was surprised to discover that despite it having existed for many years, only one engineer was bothering to read spammer forums where they talked to each other, and he was also brand new to the team. He gave me his logins and we quickly discovered spammers had found bugs in the accounts web servers they were using to blow past the antispam controls, without this being visible from any monitoring on our side. We learned many other useful things by doing this kind of \"abuser research\". But it was, again, very unusual. The team until that point had been dominated by ML-heads who just wanted to use it as a testing ground for model training.",

When I was an engineer I used to regularly engage directly with customers, and it was great to be able to talk with them one to one, address their specific issues and feel I was making a difference, particularly on a large product with many customers where you do not normally get to hear from customers much. Of course once these customers had my ear, the feature requests started to flow thick and fast, and I ended up spending way too much time on their specific issues. Which is just to say that I've changed my views over time.\nIn retrospect, the customers I helped were ones that had the most interesting problems to me, that I knew I could solve, but they were usually not the changes that would have the biggest impact across the whole customer base. By fixing a couple of customers' specific issues, I was making their lives better for sure, and that felt good, but that time could have been used more effectively for the overall customer base. PMs, managers etc should have a wider view of product needs, and it is their job to prioritize the work having that fuller context. Much as I felt at the time that those roles added little value, that was really not true.\nOf course agreed that all the points made above for PMs, managers, support having their reasons to obstruct are true in some cases, but for a well run company where those roles really do their job (and contrary to popular opinion those companies do exist), things work better if engineers do not get too involved with individual customers. I guess Google might be a good example - if you have a billion customers you probably don't want the engineers to be talking to them 1:1.",

But it also meant that backwards compatibility and the desire to ship Windows XP forever were sacred cows.\nThere are also nasty games that can be played by soliciting negative feedback for political advantage.\nDysfunction can exist with any structure. It's probably best that there's some small amount of direct user feedback as well as the big formalized feedback systems, at least so that one is a check for the performance of the other.

Good luck keeping things consistent and doing any sort of long-term planning if engineers are turning the output of those conversations directly into features. \"Engineers talking to customers but not making any changes\" would be more stable, but is still a very expensive/chaotic way to gather customer feedback.\nAdditionally, very few of those single engineers have a full knowledge of the roadmap and/or the ability to unilaterally decide direction based on some of the customer feedback or questions. \"Will this get fixed in the next two weeks?\" \"Will you build X?\" etc. You don't want your customers getting a bunch of inconsistent broken promises or wrong information.\nThe best-managed orgs I've seen have pretty heavy engineering and user experience in their product and support orgs. You need people in those roles with knowledge of both how it's built AND how it should be used, but you can't continually cram all that knowledge into every single engineer.\nA startup should start with the builders talking directly to the customers.

Part of the problem with anti-abuse work is that there's no course you can take and precious little inter-firm job hopping. Anti-abuse is a cost of business so you don't see companies competing over employees with experience like you do in some other areas like AI research. So it's all learning-by-doing and when people leave, the experience usually leaves with them.\nAfter leaving Google the anti-abuse teams at a few other tech companies did reach out. There was absolutely no consistency at all. Companies varied hugely in how much effort and skill they applied to the problem, even within the same markets. For payment fraud there is a lot of money at stake so I'd expect eBay would have had a good team, but most products at Google didn't lose money directly if there was abuse. It just led to a general worsening of the UX in ways that were hard to summarize in metrics.",

The progressive quality degradation you're describing on Meet sounds like adaptive bitrate doing its job when your connection to Google's servers is struggling.\nThe reason Teams might work better for you is probably just dumb luck with how your ISP routes to Microsoft's network versus Google's. For me in Sweden, it's the opposite ... Teams routes my media through relays in France, which adds enough latency that people constantly interrupt each other accidentally. It's maddening. Meanwhile, Meet's routing has been flawless.\nBut even if Teams works for your particular network setup, let's not pretend it's a good piece of software. Teams is an absolute resource hog that treats my CPU like a space heater and my RAM like an all-you-can-eat buffet. The interface is cluttered rubbish, it takes ages to start up, and the only reason anyone tolerates it is because Microsoft bundled it with Office 365.\nYour mileage definitely varies... sounds like you've got routing that favours Microsoft's infrastructure. Lucky you, I suppose, but that doesn't make Teams any less dogwater for those of us stuck with their poorly-placed European relays.",

An increasing part of industry profits started coming from entertainment (or worse, psychological exploitation) instead of selling the customer a\nuseful tool\n. For example, good budgeting-software has to help the user understand and model and achieve a goal, while a \"good\" slot-machine may benefit from confusion and distraction and a giant pull-handle.\n2. \"Must work on a touchscreen that fits in a pocket\" support drags certain things to a lowest common denominator.\n3. UX as a switching-cost for customers has started happening more on a per-product rather than a per-OS basis. Instead of learning the Windows or Mac \"way\" of screens and shortcuts, individual programs--especially those dang Electron apps--make their own reinventions of the wheel.",

There are concrete UX metholodogies such as Hierarchical Task Analysis or Heuristic Evaluation. These allow us to evaluate concrete KPIs, such as number of steps and levels of navigation required for an action, in order to evaluate just how good or bad (or better said, complicated a UX design is).\nLets say we apply the HTA. Starting from the top of your navigation level when you want to execute the task, count the number of operations and various levels of navigation you have to go through with the new design, compared to just clicking and correcting the e-mail address in-place? How much time does it take you to write your e-mail in the both cases? How many times do you have to switch back and forth between the main interface and the context menu google kindly placed for us? \nNow, phase out of your e-mail writing window and evaluate how many various actions you can execute in the Google Workspace. Most of them are likely to have a few quirks like this. Now multiply the estimated number of actions with the number of quirks and you will slowly start to see the immense cognitive load the average user has to face in using, or shall I rather say \"combating\" the google products' UX.",

Most companies unfortunately dont have a nice UX these days, because common UX practices like not making user think (i.e. overcomplicating the UIs) and not blocking users (showing annoying popups in the middle of UI workflows) somehow became a lost art. Some products are inherently easy to use like draw.io for example. I really like the UX on Stripe, in particular their onboarding process. There is also a semi-famous e-commerce company, in the furniture space. I forgot their name (something with W?), but I ordered something once, and was really impressed by how smooth and uncomplicated the process from browsing the inventory to checkout and delivery itself was.",

Get unreasonably concrete about real user pain (tickets, observation, “why” drills), and let solutions fall out of that—otherwise you’ll build complexity to justify a preconceived answer.\n\n - Engineering is a team sport: alignment beats being right. The job is getting to “right” together: create shared understanding, reduce misalignment (the real cause of “slow” teams), avoid “winning” debates into silent resistance, use metrics carefully (they get gamed), and design process to reduce uncertainty rather than produce paperwork.\n\n - Ship early, then iterate—clarity over cleverness. Bias to action: drafts and MVPs teach faster than armchair perfection. Write code and docs that are obvious at 2am during an incident, not “impressive.” And treat novelty as debt you repay in ops/hiring/cognitive overhead—spend your “innovation tokens” where you’re uniquely paid to innovate.\n\n - Do less: deletion is a superpower (and often the fastest optimization). Prefer “code you never wrote” (or work you removed) over clever additions. Many performance wins come from removing unnecessary computation, not adding fancy machinery.\n\n - Respect scale and failure: compatibility, migrations, and leaky abstractions are the real product. At scale, even bugs become dependencies; deprecations are migrations with empathy/tooling/time. Abstractions don’t erase complexity—they postpone it until on-call—so keep a working mental model of what’s underneath.\n\n - Make your impact legible and invest in compounding. Code doesn’t advocate for you—people do—so communicate outcomes, not just activity. Use writing/teaching to force clarity and deepen your own understanding; treat “glue work” as deliberate, bounded, and visible. Build psychological safety by saying “I don’t know.” Maintain relationships because your network outlasts any job. And manage your career like compound interest: protect time, practice deliberately, turn scar tissue into reusable playbooks.",

If you win every debate, you’re probably accumulating silent resistance\nThe common thread here is that in large organizations, your impact is largely measured by how much you're liked. It's completely vibes-based. Stack ranking (which Google used to have; not sure if it still does) just codifies popularity.\nWhat's the issue with that? People who are autistic tend to do really badly through no fault of their own. These systems are basically a selection filter for allistic people.\nThis comes up in PSC (\"perf\" at Meta, \"calibration\" elsewhere) where the exact same set of facts can be constructed as a win or a loss and the only difference is vibes. I've seen this time and time again.\nIn one case I saw a team of 6 go away and do nothing for 6 months then come back and shut down. If they're liked, \"we learned a lot\". If they're not, \"they had no impact\".\nYears ago Google studied the elements of a successful team and a key element was psychological safety. This [1] seems related but more recent. This was originally done 10-15 years ago. I agree with that. The problem? Permanent layoffs culture, designed entirely to suppress wages, kills pyschological safety and turns survival into a game of being liked and manufacturing impact.\n> 18. Most performance wins come from removing work, not adding cleverness\nOne thing I really appreciated about Google was that it has a very strict style guide and the subset of C++ in particular that you can use is (was?) very limited. At the time, this included \"no exceptions\", no mutable function arguments and adding templtes had an extremely high bar to be allowed.\nWhy? To avoid arguments about style issues. That's huge. But also because C++ in particular seemed to attract people who were in love with thier own cleverness. I've seem some horrific uses of templates (not at Google) that made code incredibly difficult to test for very little gain.\n> 9. Most “slow” teams are actually misaligned teams\nI think this is the most important point but I would generalize it and restate it as: most problems are organizational problems.\nAt Meta, for example, product teams were incentivized to ship and their impact was measured in metric bumps. But there was no incentive to support what you've already shipped beyond it not blowing up. So in many teams there was a fire and forget approach to filing a bug and forgetting about it, to the point where it became a company priority to have SLAs on old bugs, which caused the inevitable: people just downgrading bug priorities to avoid SLAs.\nThat's an organizational problem where the participants have figured out that shiping is the only thing they get rewarded for. Things like documentation, code quality and bug fixes were paid lip service to only.\nDisclaimer: Xoogler, ex-Facebooker.\n[1]:\nhttps://www.aristotleperformance.com/post/project-aristotle-...",

Analysis paralysis creates nothing.\nI've met Addy and I'll be generous, but strong disagree here, and this really shows a huge blind spot in how software is being developed today that hurts everyone.\nThere aren't two extremes between \"theoretical debate\" and just shipping the first crap you can slap together. Software engineering will\nnever\nbecome a real discipline when industry keeps ignoring the lessons of every other field of engineering: gather some requirements first.\nWant to know what users want? How about asking them? What about doing some research on what tools they are using now (or not) and finding out what's wrong with them. What about doing a user study? What about analyzing competing and previous products?\nHow about then drawing up a list of things that\nsay what the thing will do\n? You can keep the list short, sure. Build a prototype (maybe for internal use)? Sure. No need to have every piece of functionality there.\nBut there's an enormous blind spot here I'd be remiss to point out. Back in the shrink-wrapped software days, back when products took months and sometimes years to develop, man, people really planned out what they were going to build! And I'm not just romanticizing that era--there was a lot that could go wrong, and many misses--but\ntons\nof software developed in that manner sticks with us today, not just the designs and usage patterns, but big chunks of the code too. It's not all legacy cruft; people actually thought about what they wanted to build, and then laboriously built and tested it--with crappier tools, longer build times, and many disadvantages like huge teams, crappier communication, and a whole lot less computational power.\nThere are other things in this list that are good advice, but I felt like this cannot possibly be the whole truth to 14 years of experience. In other words, please don't just ship your crap to us the first time it functions.",

      "content": "When I joined Google ~14 years ago, I thought the job was about writing great code. I was partly right. But the longer I’ve stayed, the more I’ve realized that the engineers who thrive aren’t necessarily the best programmers - they’re the ones who’ve figured out how to navigate everything around the code: the people, the politics, the alignment, the ambiguity.\nThese lessons are what I wish I’d known earlier. Some would have saved me months of frustration. Others took years to fully understand. None of them are about specific technologies - those change too fast to matter. They’re about the patterns that keep showing up, project after project, team after team.\nI’m sharing them because I’ve benefited enormously from engineers who did the same for me. Consider this my attempt to pay it forward.\n1. The best engineers are obsessed with solving user problems.\nIt’s seductive to fall in love with a technology and go looking for places to apply it. I’ve done it. Everyone has. But the engineers who create the most value work backwards: they become obsessed with understanding user problems deeply, and let solutions emerge from that understanding.\nUser obsession means spending time in support tickets, talking to users, watching users struggle, asking “why” until you hit bedrock. The engineer who truly understands the problem often finds that the elegant solution is simpler than anyone expected.\nThe engineer who starts with a solution tends to build complexity in search of a justification.\n2. Being right is cheap. Getting to right together is the real work.\nYou can win every technical argument and lose the project. I’ve watched brilliant engineers accrue silent resentment by always being the smartest person in the room. The cost shows up later as “mysterious execution issues” and “strange resistance.”\nThe skill isn’t being right. It’s entering discussions to align on the problem, creating space for others, and remaining skeptical of your own certainty.\nStrong opinions, weakly held - not because you lack conviction, but because decisions made under uncertainty shouldn’t be welded to identity.\n3. Bias towards action. Ship. You can edit a bad page, but you can’t edit a blank one.\nThe quest for perfection is paralyzing. I’ve watched engineers spend weeks debating the ideal architecture for something they’ve never built. The perfect solution rarely emerges from thought alone - it emerges from contact with reality. AI can in many ways help here.\nFirst do it, then do it right, then do it better. Get the ugly prototype in front of users. Write the messy first draft of the design doc. Ship the MVP that embarrasses you slightly. You’ll learn more from one week of real feedback than a month of theoretical debate.\nMomentum creates clarity. Analysis paralysis creates nothing.\n4. Clarity is seniority. Cleverness is overhead.\nThe instinct to write clever code is almost universal among engineers. It feels like proof of competence.\nBut software engineering is what happens when you add time and other programmers. In that environment, clarity isn’t a style preference - it’s operational risk reduction.\nYour code is a strategy memo to strangers who will maintain it at 2am during an outage. Optimize for their comprehension, not your elegance. The senior engineers I respect most have learned to trade cleverness for clarity, every time.\n5. Novelty is a loan you repay in outages, hiring, and cognitive overhead.\nTreat your technology choices like an organization with a small “innovation token” budget. Spend one each time you adopt something materially non-standard. You can’t afford many.\nThe punchline isn’t “never innovate.” It’s “innovate only where you’re uniquely paid to innovate.” Everything else should default to boring, because boring has known failure modes.\nThe “best tool for the job” is often the “least-worst tool across many jobs”-because operating a zoo becomes the real tax.\n6. Your code doesn’t advocate for you. People do.\nEarly in my career, I believed great work would speak for itself. I was wrong. Code sits silently in a repository. Your manager mentions you in a meeting, or they don’t. A peer recommends you for a project, or someone else.\nIn large organizations, decisions get made in meetings you’re not invited to, using summaries you didn’t write, by people who have five minutes and twelve priorities. If no one can articulate your impact when you’re not in the room, your impact is effectively optional.\nThis isn’t strictly about self-promotion. It’s about making the value chain legible to everyone- including yourself.\n7. The best code is the code you never had to write.\nWe celebrate creation in engineering culture. Nobody gets promoted for deleting code, even though deletion often improves a system more than addition. Every line of code you don’t write is a line you never have to debug, maintain, or explain.\nBefore you build, exhaust the question: “What would happen if we just… didn’t?” Sometimes the answer is “nothing bad,” and ",

Just average a bunch of similar stuff and you get a Gaussian. Have a look at the python snippet below, we get an almost-Gaussian out of a uniform just by averaging! I was surprised to learn that there's a similar (in spirit, not form) aggregation rule for order statistics (this kind of aggregation rule is the subject of extreme value theory).\nOLS is often introduced assuming Gaussian errors, because in that case OLS is the maximum likelihood estimator (which has desirable properties). As Ludwig mentioned, you don't need the Gaussian assumption for OLS to be a \"good\" estimator. The Gauss-Markov theorem says it's sufficient for the errors to be uncorrelated and have constant variance. If they have non-constant variance and you know their variance, you can pre-scale your data, run OLS, and get a good result (this is called weighted least squares or WLS).OLS can also be thought of as a specific incarnation of the \"Generalized Method of Moments\" which can handle much more complicated situations. Including errors with different variance.\nAs for the original article, all the quantities it considers can be computed by hand (empirical covariance matrix, it's eigenvectors/eigenvalues, the regression coefficients). If you notice an unexpected difference in empirical quantities then it's time to turn the crank of the math and see how the closed-form solutions might differ.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n import numpy as np\n import pandas as pd\n\n x = np.random.uniform(size=(1_000_000, 100))\n x = np.mean(x, axis=1)\n pd.Series(x.ravel()).hist(bins=100)",

The result looked a bit strange to me, because the line doesn't really seem to pass \"centrally\" through the data. It looks a little \"tilted\":\nSo, instead, I then diagonalized the covariance matrix to obtain the eigenvector that gives the direction of maximum variance. This is shown by the black arrow in the figure below. This one does indeed point in the direction that I would expect:\nSo, I am looking for a bit of an intuitive explanation for what is going on here. I know that they are not measuring the same thing - the fit is minimizing the sum of the squared \"errors\", the vertical distances between the measured values and the fitted model. Whereas the eigenvector is chosen to maximize variance.\nBut I guess I am surprised by the result - I would've expected the fit to go through the center of the data cluster, and not have this bias. Is it something to do with the fact that minimizing the vertical distances somehow breaks the symmetry in the system? Is it inappropriate to apply a basic linear fit to such data?\nHere is the code:\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef get_correlated_dataset(n, dependency, mu, scale):\n    latent = np.random.randn(n, 2)\n    dependent = latent.dot(dependency)\n    scaled = dependent * scale\n    scaled_with_offset = scaled + mu\n    return scaled_with_offset[:, 0], scaled_with_offset[:, 1]\n\n# Generate Data\ndependency = [[30, 30],\n              [30,  2]]\nmu = [150,-100]\nscale = 1\nx, y = get_correlated_dataset(20000, dependency, mu, scale)\n\n# Calculate direction of maximum variance (eigenvector of covariance matrix)\ncovariance_matrix = np.cov( np.stack((x, y), axis=0) )\nEIGVALS,EIGVECS = np.linalg.eig( covariance_matrix )\nvec = EIGVECS[:, np.argmax(EIGVALS)] # Get the eigenvector corresponding to largest eigenvalue\n\n# Magnitude of vector, 3 standard deviations, and mean (for plotting arrow)\nvec_norm = np.sqrt(vec[0]**2 + vec[1]**2)\nsigma3 = np.sqrt(EIGVALS.max())*3\nmu_x, mu_y = np.mean(x), np.mean(y)\n\n# Linear fit to the data\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\n\nfig1,ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))\nax1.plot( x , y ,'o',label=\"Generated Data\")\nax1.plot( x , x*slope+intercept ,label=\"Linear Fit\")\nax1.quiver(mu_x, mu_y, sigma3*vec[0]/vec_norm, sigma3*vec[1]/vec_norm, zorder=10,angles='xy', scale_units='xy',scale=1,label=\"Eigenvector of Covariance Matrix\")\nregression\npca\ncovariance\nfitting\nShare\nCite\nImprove this question\nFollow\nedited\n2 days ago\nUser1865345\n12k\n13\n13 gold badges\n27\n27 silver badges\n43\n43 bronze badges\nasked\n2 days ago\nteeeeee\n339\n3\n3 silver badges\n12\n12 bronze badges\n$\\endgroup$\n15\n1\n$\\begingroup$\nI don't have any idea what is going on here, but there is a lot of overplotting in your graphs.

During the process, Eurostar even suggested that we were somehow attempting to blackmail them!\nThis occurred despite our disclosure going unanswered and receiving no responses to our requests for acknowledgement or a remediation timeline.\nThe vulnerabilities were eventually fixed, hence we have now published.\nThe core lesson is that old web and API weaknesses still apply even when an LLM is in the loop.\nIntroduction\nI first encountered the chatbot as a normal\nEurostar\ncustomer while planning a trip. When it opened, it clearly told me that “the answers in this chatbot are generated by AI”, which is good disclosure but immediately raised my curiosity about how it worked and what its limits were.\nEurostar publishes a\nvulnerability disclosure programme (VDP)\n, which meant I had permission to take a closer look at the chatbot’s behaviour as long as I stayed within those rules. So this work was done while using the site as a legitimate customer, within the scope of the VDP.\nAlmost all websites for companies like train operators have a chatbot on them. What we’re used to seeing is a menu-driven bot which attempts to direct you to available FAQ pages or help articles, trying to minimise interactions which require putting you in front of a human being operator on the other end. These sort of chatbots either don’t understand free text input, or have very limited capabilities.\nHowever, some of the chatbots now use can understand free text, and sometimes even live speech. They still sit on top of familiar menu driven systems, but instead of forcing you down fixed paths, they let you speak naturally and guide you in a more flexible way.\nThat was exactly the behaviour I saw here. I could ask slightly less structured or less predictable questions and see the chatbot respond in a way that clearly went beyond a simple scripted flow. That was the first sign that this was likely backed by a modern LLM rather than a fixed rules-based bot.\nAt the same time, it was also clear that the chatbot was not willing to answer everything. Asking it something innocuous but off topic, such as “How are you today?”, always produced the exact same refusal message. The wording never varied. That immediately suggested I was not hitting the model directly, but a programmatic guardrail sitting in front of it.\nA real model level refusal usually changes slightly from one attempt to the next because of how language models work. This did not. It was identical every time, which strongly pointed to an external policy layer deciding what was and was not allowed before the request even reached the model.\nThat observation was what led me to look at how the chatbot actually worked behind the scenes.\nHow it works\nFirst, let’s open up Burp Suite so we can intercept the traffic and see what’s actually going on here.\nThe chatbot is fully API driven, with a REST API in use at https://site-api.eurostar.com/chatbot/api/agents/default.\nThe chat history is sent as a POST request to this endpoint, including the latest message. The server then responds with an answer chunk and other metadata for the chatbot to display.\nAn example is shown below of the default messages shown in the chat, ",

In the Intel World, we first had the iAPX 432, which was an object-capability design. To say it failed miserably is overselling its success by a good margin.\nThe 8086 was sort-of segmented to get 20 bit addresses out of a 16 bit machine and a stop-gap and a huge success. The 80286 did things \"properly\" again and went all-in on the segments when going to virtual memory...and sucked. Best I remember, it was used almost exclusively as a faster 8086, with the 80286 modes used to page memory in and out and with the \"reset and recover\" hack to then get back to real mode for real work.\nThe 80386 introduced the flat address space and paged virtual memory not because of backwards-compatibility, but because it\ncould\nand it was clearly The Right Thing™.",

Because array-crunching performance is more important than safety. Because a fix for a V8 vulnerability can be quickly deployed while a hardware vulnerability fix cannot. Because you can express any object model on top of flat memory, but expressing one object model (or flat memory) in terms of another object model usually costs a lot. Because nobody ever agreed of what the object model should be. But most importantly: because \"memory safety\" is not worth the costs.",

          "text": "What a clueless post. Even ignoring their massive overstatement of the difficulty and hardware complexity of hardware mapping tables, they appear to not even understand the problems solved by mapping tables.\nOkay, let us say you have a physical object store. How are the actual contents of those objects stored? Are they stored in individual, isolated memory blocks? What if I want to make a 4 GB array? Do I need to have 4 GB memory blocks? What if I only have 6 GB? That is obviously unworkable.\nOkay, we can solve that by compacting our physical object store onto a physical linear store and just presenting a object store as a abstraction. Sure, we have a physical linear store, but we never present that to the user. But what if somebody deallocates a object? Obviously we should be able to reuse that underlying physical linear store. What if they allocated a 4 GB array? Obviously we need to be able to fragment that into smaller pieces for future objects. What if we deallocated 4 GB of disjoint 4 KB objects? Should we fail to allocate a 8 KB object just because the fragments are not contiguous? Oh, just keep in mind the precise structure of the underlying physical store to avoid that (what a leaky and error-prone abstraction). Oh, but what about if there are multiple programs running, some potentially even buggy, how the hell am I supposed to keep track of the shared physical store to keep track of global fragmentation of the shared resource?\nOkay, we can solve all of that with a level of indirection by giving you a physical object key instead of a physical object \"reference\". You present the key, and then we have a runtime structure that allows us to lookup where in the physical linear store we have put that data. This allows us to move and compact the underlying storage while letting you have a stable key. Now we have a mapping between object key and linear physical memory. But what if there are multiple programs on the same machine, some of which may be untrustworthy? What if they just start using keys they were not given? Obviously we need some scheme of preventing anybody from using any key. Maybe we could solve that by tagging every object in the system with a list of every program allowed to use it? But the number of programs is dynamic and if we have millions or billions of objects, each new program would require re-tagging all of those objects. We could make that list only encode \"allowed\" programs which would save space and amount of cleanup work, but how would the hardware do that lookup efficiently and how would it store that data efficiently?\nOkay, we can solve that by having a per-program mapping between object key to linear physical memory. Oh no, that is looking suspiciously close to the per-program mapping between linear virtual memory to linear physical memory. Hopefully there are no other problems that will just result in us getting back to right where we started. Oh no, here comes another one. How is your machine storing this mapping between object key to linear physical memory? If you will remember from your data structures courses, those would usually be implemented as either a hash table or a tree. A tree sounds too suspiciously close to what currently exists, so let us use a hash table.\nOkay, cool, how big should the hash table be? What if I want a billion objects in this program and a thousand objects in a different program? I guess we should use a growable hash table. All that happens is that if we allocate enough objects we allocate a new, dynamically sized storage structure then bulk rehash and insert all the old objects. That is amortized O(1), just at the cost of a unpredictable pause on potentially any memory allocation which can not only be gigantic, but is proportional to the number of live allocations. That is fine if our goal is just putting in a whole hardware garbage collector, but not really applicable for high performance computing. For high performance computing we would want worse case bounded time and memory cost (not amortized, per-operation).\nOkay, I guess we have to go with a per-program tree-based mapping between object key to linear physical memory. But it is still a object store, so we won, right? How is the hardware going to walk that efficiently? For the hardware to walk that efficiently, you are going to want a highly regular structure with high fanout to both maximize the value of the cache lines you will load and to reduce the worst case number of cache lines you need to load. So you will want a B-Tree structure of some form. Oh no, that is exactly what hardware mapping tables look like.\nBut it is still a object store, so we won, right? But what if I deallocated 4 GB of disjoint 4 KB objects? You could move and recompact all of that memory, but why? You already have a mapping structure with a layer of indirection via object keys. Just create a interior mapping within a object between the object-relative offsets and potentially disjoint linear physical memory. Then you do not need physically contiguous backing, you can use disjoint physical linear store to provide the abstraction of a object linear store.\nAnd now we have a per-program tree-based mapping between linear object address to linear physical memory. But what if the objects are of various sizes? In some cases the hardware will traverse the mapping from object key to linear object store, then potentially need to traverse another mapping from a large linear object address to linear physical memory. If we just compact the linear object store mappings, then we can unify the trees and just provide a common linear address to linear physical memory mapping and the tree-based mapping will be tightly bounded for all walks.\nAnd there we have it, a per-program tree-based mapping between linear virtual memory and linear physical memory one step at a time.",

Could that be solved or performant enough? Maybe. Is a memory allocation strategy that can not free objects a currently viable solution for general computing to the degree you argue people not adopting it are whiners? No.\nI see no reason to accept a fallacious argument from authority in lieu of actual arguments.

They went out of business several months ago. I don't have the inside scoop, but I expect the biggest issue is that they were trying to sell it as a performance improvement (hardware based memory allocation), which it probably was... but also they would have been starting from a slower base anyway. \"38% faster than linear memory\" doesn't sound so great when your chip is half as fast as the competition to start with.\nIt also didn't protect objects on the stack (afaik) unlike CHERI. But on the other hand it's way simpler than CHERI conceptually, and I think it handled temporal safety more elegantly.\nPersonally I think Rust combined with memory tagging is going to be the sweet spot.

But it’s unlikely for two reasons.\nOne is that doing it while avoiding second system syndrome takes teams with a huge amount of both expertise and discipline. That includes the discipline to be ruthless about exterminating complexity and saying no. That’s institutionally hard.\nThe second is that there isn’t strong demand. What we have is good enough for what most of the market wants, and right now all the demand for new architecture work is in the GPU/NPU/TPU space for AI. Nobody is interested in messing with the foundation when all the action is there. The CPU in that world is just a job manager for the AI tensor math machine.\nQuantum computing will be similar.

These systems can easily ban dynamic allocation, statically precompute all input sizes, and given enough effort, can mostly be statically proven given the constrained input and output space.\nOr, to make this thesis more concise: I believe that OS and architecture level memory safety (object model addressing, CHERI, pointer tagging, etc.) is only necessary when the application space is not constrained. Once the application space is fully constrained you are better off fixing the application (SPARK is actually a great example in this direction).\nMobile phones are the demand and where we see the research and development happening. They’re walled off enough to be able to throw away some backwards compatibility and cross-compatibility, but still demand the ability to run multiple applications which are not statically analyzed and are untrusted by default.

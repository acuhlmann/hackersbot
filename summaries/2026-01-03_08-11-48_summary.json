Contrary to the recurring claim that RSS is dead, most of the traffic to my website still comes from RSS feeds, even in 2̶0̶2̶5̶ 2026! In fact, one of my silly little games became moderately popular because someone found it in my RSS feed and shared it on HN. [1]\nFrom the referer (sic) data in my web server logs (which is not completely reliable but still offers some insight), the three largest sources of traffic to my website are:\n1. RSS feeds - People using RSS aggregator services as well as local RSS reader tools.\n2. Newsletters - I was surprised to discover just how many tech newsletters there are on the Web and how active their user bases are. Once in a while, a newsletter picks up one of my silly or quirky posts, which then brings a large number of visits from its followers.\n3. Search engines - Traffic from Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing and similar search engines. This is usually for specific tools, games and HOWTO posts available on my website that some visitors tend to return to repeatedly.\n[1]\nhttps://susam.net/from-web-feed-to-186850-hits.html",

We had a news letter that would summarize each of these. Many organizations like ours would post summaries of many things to a single blog post, basically the same as the newsletter. However, this was cumbersome. For example, if someone in the community had a question, it was much clearer to link to a single post on our site that answered the question AND ONLY answered that question. It made for much better community engagement, better search engine indexing, cleaner content management, and just a better experience for everyone involved.",

The effect of this was that people had to create content\nwithin facebook\ninstead of outside it. This reoriented the flow of content creation so that it must originate inside of Facebook, removing the ability to use FB as a passive consumer of content created in a workflow where the creators chose the entire flow.\nIMHO this is one of the biggest steps down ever in FB history.

That is how I got started. I replaced the default index.asp with my own and began building from there. A nice bonus of this approach was that the default website included a server-side guestbook application that stored comments in an MS Access database. Reading through its source code taught me server-side scripting. I used that newfound knowledge to write my own server-side applications.\nOf course, this was a long time ago. That website still exists but today most of it is just a collection of static HTML files generated by a Common Lisp program I wrote for myself. The only parts that are not static are the guestbook and comment forms, which are implemented in CL using Hunchentoot.",

Each post will create parallel but different conversations.\n- Dumping links is frowned upon. You should be a genuine participant in each community, even if you just repost the same stuff. Automation does not help much there.\n- RSS and newsletters are the only audiences that you control, and they're worth growing. Everywhere else, people who explicitly want to follow you might never see your updates.\n- You should own the domain you post to. This is your address on the internet, and it should stay yours\n- People do check your personal website. I was surprised to hear friends and acquaintances refer to things I post on my website.",

POSSE is about staying in touch with current friends now, rather than the potential of staying in touch with friends in the future.\nFriends are more important than federation.\nBy focusing on relationships that matter to people rather than architectural ideals, from a human perspective, POSSE is more important than\nfederation\n. Additionally, if federated approaches take a POSSE approach first, they will likely get better adoption (everyone wants to stay in touch with their friends), and thereby more rapidly approach that federated future.\nPOSSE is beyond blogging.\nIt's a key part of why and how the IndieWeb movement is\ndifferent\nfrom just \"everyone blog on their own site\", and also different from \"everyone just install and run (YourFavoriteSocialSoftware)\" etc.\nmonoculture\nsolutions.\nWhy In General\nPOSSE is considered a robust and preferable syndication model\nfor the following reasons:\nReduce 3rd party dependence.\nBy posting directly to your own site, you're not dependent on 3rd Party services to do so -- if you can access your site, you can publish your content. On the contrary with PESOS,\nwhen the 3rd party site is down\n, you are unable to add content.\nOwnership.\nBy posting\nfirst\non your own site, you create a direct ownership chain that can be traced back to you without any intervening 3rd party services (silos) TOS's getting in the way (which is a vulnerability of\nPESOS\n).\nOwn canonical URLs to your content.\nCanonical URLs to your content are on your domain.\nCopies can cite the original.\nBy posting content first to your own site (and thus creating a permalink for it), copies that you post on 3rd Party services can link or cite the original on your site (see\nsyndication_formats\nand\nPOSSE Notes to Twitter\n)\nBetter search.\nSearching public content on your own domain (with any web search engine of your choice) works better than depending on\nsilos\nexclusively to search your posts (e.g. Twitter for a while only showed recent tweets in search results.\nFacebook\nstill has very poor search results).\nbackfeed\ncan be used to pull in (reverse syndicate) responses from other services\nallows taking advantage of other services' social layers and aggregation features while storing the canonical copy of your content on your own site\n...\nWhy Link To Your Original\nCommon\nPOSSE\npractice is to link from POSSE copies to your original, using a\npermashortlink\n. Here are a few reasons why:\nDiscovery of your original content.\ndiscovery\nof your original content from the copies on 3rd party services is enabled by the permashortlinks to your originals posted on said services\nSubvert spammers who copy your posts.\nWhen spammers (e.g. @sin3rss) mindlessly copy from your POSSE copies and repost, they also copy the link back to the original, and thus provide more distribution for people to find and view your original post. \"\n2011-01-09 internet aikido\n\" of a sort.\nBetter ranking for your original posts.\nIf/when your POSSE copies are themselves copied by others and (re)posted elsewhere (e.g. manual retweets, RSS bots etc.), when the copies link to your original posts, search engines figure that out by following those links back to the original and ranking it higher.\nHow to\nHow to implement\nThis section is for web developers implementing POSSE.\nIn General\nIn general, when your content posting software posts something, it should also post a copy to the\nsilo\ndestinations of your choice, with an\noriginal post link\n(e.g.\npermashortlink\nor\npermashortcitation\n) back to your original.\nThe details of how to do so vary per destination. See the silo-specific sections below.\nOnce you have posted the copy to the silo, you should:\nlink to the syndicated copy from the original in a\nposts-elsewhere\nsection on your post.\nUser Interface\nThe best user interface (UI) is automatic, dependable, and invisible. If you can implement POSSEing in a way that always does exactly what you want, predictably, then no explicit UI is needed.\nPreview\nOne way to provide more predictability and inspire confidence is to show what will be POSSEd (within the limitations of the destination) as a preview before publishing\n(needs screenshot)\nTwitter\nMain article:\nTwitter#POSSE_to_Twitter\nTwitter\nis perhaps the most popular POSSE destination and a good place to start.\nIf you can start posting notes (tweets) to your own site and POSSEing to Twitter,\nin",

(Music video:)\nhttps://youtu.be/gAjR4_CbPpQ\nIn this song, which is also chapter four of the movie Interstella 5000 movie (spoilers from here!), the knocked-out singers are scanned, parameterized, brainwashed, uploaded into The Matrix, and then used in the following songs of the movie-album to robotically mass produce music.\nIt makes\nperfect\nsense that the BPM is 123.45 because that’s exactly the sort of thing you get when a manager (who’s shown at the end!) just enters some numbers on the keyboard into the bpm field. They don’t keysmash the numpad; they just hit 123456789 until the field is full!\nSo not only does the song itself convey what some boss thinks is music, robotically beating at 123.45 bpm, but it is itself about being endlessly-rotating brainwashed-boring cogs in a pop music production industrial machine. I’m pretty sure the movie scene cuts and animations are timed specifically to the beats of the song, but knowing that they’re timed to a machine-specific bpm that a human would never select at random with a metronome?\nAbsolute genius.\nI had no idea. Thanks for posting this.\nEDIT: At 123.4567bpm, I think the track has precisely\n0.2345\nseconds of silence before the first 'beat' of the song and actually has\n456\nbeats total, which is either numerological nonsense or pure genius by Daft Punk.

And why bother to add a decimal point? What is meant by \"robotically beating at 123.45 bpm\"? Any fixed tempo beats robotically.\nYour theory could be correct but it feels like connecting too many dots to me. 123.45 is a bizarre (and kind of human in that way) tempo that strikes me as more of a cheeky easter egg than a deeper connection to themes of corporate mass-produced roboticism (if they even did intend that as the exact tempo).",

Although DP never cared to enter the details of that particular composition, most likely memory hole'd by the protagonists.)\nSo no, this is definitely not the theme of the song. There are several years between the actual songwriting and the release of the movie.\nHeck, if you actually see the movie, the ending sequence kinda explains that this is \"one\" of many interpretations of the record...\nTaking a look at past interviews, it is more likely that 5555 is about what surrounded the actual release of Discovery (hugely anticipated sequel to a magnum opus that was wildly different from expectations) rather than an idea that was here from the start; see also Human After All for a continuation on this theme.",

      "content": "Was Daft Punk Having a Laugh When They Chose the Tempo of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger?\nBy John Scalo\nGoogle \"harder better faster stronger bpm\"\nand Google’s “AI Overview” will tell you:\nDaft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” generally sits around 123 BPM (Beats Per Minute), though some analyses find it slightly higher (like 123.48 BPM) or list different BPMs in remixes/workouts, with exact figures varying slightly by source and version.\nSpotify’s metadata database,\nSongBPM\n, and most other online BPM databases list it at exactly 123.\nBut I think our helmet-clad robot friends might have been making a little joke that we’ve apparently all missed. The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is actually 123.45.\nHow do I know this? It so happens that for over 10 years I’ve written an app called\nTempi\nthat shows the music BPM in real time, so I know a little bit about the science and algorithms behind music tempo detection.\nMost tempo detection software works basically the same way:\nA specialized algorithm called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) collects overlapping energy levels at different frequency bands.\nThose levels are refined into well-defined peaks that represent rhythmic events in the track.\nAnother algorithm (autocorrelation) looks for patterns, or more accurately\nperiodicity\n, in those peaks.\nBut these patterns are tricky because there’s all kinds of noise, performance inaccuracies, and rhythmic harmonics throwing things off. All that is to say, a) it’s complicated and b) it’s not perfectly accurate.\nWhen I make changes to my own system of course I need some way to know if it’s getting better or worse, so I have a test library of hundreds of song snippets that I score it against. One of these songs is Daft Punk’s HBFS, and early on I noticed something strange about that track.\nAlmost all electronic music is synced to a sequencer and so obviously is going to have a very steady tempo. But while the vast majority of electronic music tracks I test have an “integral” tempo – meaning their tempo is exactly some round number like 95, and not a fraction like 95.2 – my software always finds the BPM of HBFS to be somewhere between 123 and 124, but not exactly either. For years I’ve chalked this up to inconsistencies with my system and didn’t think much of it. But lately I’ve made improvements to the system so that it’s much more accurate and it now tells me the BPM of HBFS is 123.4.\nAnd that got me thinking, “Hmm. Did these guys pick that tempo because they have a sense of humor? And if so, how far would they take it?”\nTo get to the bottom of this I needed to establish what the BPM of HBFS really is.\nAnd that’s actually pretty easy to do…\nHere’s a Venn diagram showing the overlap between human and computer capabilities in the digital realm:\nComputers can do almost all “computer-y” things (i.e. things that can be entirely done on a computer) MUCH better, faster, (and stronger?) than humans. But for the time being there remain a few things that humans can do very easily which computers find difficult. Along with counting traffic lights and crosswalks, one of those things is finding the exact BPM of a song. Not an estimate like most software does, but the\nexact\nvalue with extreme precision across the entire song. Anyone with a basic sense of rhythm and an audio app can do this.\nHere’s how:\nOpen the song in an audio app like Logic, Audition, Ableton, Reaper, ProTools, etc.\nZoom in on the waveform a little bit so you can see the shape of the beats.\nFind the first obvious beat – meaning it has a well-defined waveform peak – and the last obvious beat. Let’s call these “bookend” beats.\nMeasure the exact duration in seconds between the bookend beats.\nPlay the song and\ncount\nall the beats starting at the first bookend beat and ending at the last bookend beat. (If you have an old school calculator, an easy way to do this is type “1+1=” and then just keep tapping “=” to add 1 on each beat.)\nThen to get the\nexact\ntempo of the track, averaged throughout the entire thing, use this formula:\nbpm = 60 * (number_of_beats - 1) / duration\nComputers have a rough time of this because they don’t really know how to “keep a beat”, and the algorithms that\ncan\nfind the beat do a lot better when they already know the estimated BPM, which is obviously a chicken/egg problem.\nFor the first bookend beat in HBFS I used the first beat after the “whooshing” intro, at around 5.58s. The last bookend beat I used the last “work” at about the 3:41.85 mark. (“Never” and “Over” aren’t good candidates because you can’t see their waveform peaks.)\nThat gives exactly 446 beats or 445 intervals.\nI tried this with two different copies of HBFS. The Discovery CD rip I have of the song has a duration between the bookend beats of 216.276, so:\nbpm = 60 * 445 / 216.276 = 123.4499403556\nThe “YouTube official audio” track I tested has a duration of 216.282, so:\nbpm = 60 * 445 / 216.282 = 123.4533651445\nThe original Discovery CD version has obviously unde",

In its statement, Venezuela’s government confirmed that the city had come under attack, as well as three other states: Miranda, La Guaira and Aragua.\n“The only objective of this attack is to seize control of Venezuela’s strategic resources, in particular its oil and minerals,” it said, calling on the international community to denounce what it called a flagrant violation of international law that put millions of lives at risk.\nThe president of neighbouring Colombia, Gustavo Petro, claimed on social media that Venezuela was coming under attack. “Right now they are bombing Caracas … bombing it with missiles,” Petro wrote on X, calling for an immediate emergency session of the UN security council.\nSoon after CBS News reported that Trump had had ordered the attacks – including on military facilities. The White House and Pentagon did not respond to request for comment.\nAt least seven explosions were heard about 2am local time and people in various neighbourhoods rushed to the street, the Associated Press reported. “The whole ground shook. This is horrible. We heard explosions and planes in the distance,” said Carmen Hidalgo, a 21-year-old office worker.\nEyewitnesses reported seeing smoke pouring from two key military installations in Caracas: the La Carlota military airfield at the heart of the city and the Fuerte Tiuna military base where Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, has long been thought to live. Another important airport to the east of Caracas, Higuerote, also appeared to come under attack.\nThe explosions come after a\nfive-month US pressure campaign against Maduro\n, which many analysts believe is designed to topple the Venezuelan leader. Since August, Donald Trump has ordered a massive military buildup off Venezuela’s northern coast and conducted a series of deadly airstrikes on supposed “narco boats”.\nTrump has repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela, amid efforts to pressure Maduro to leave office, including expanded sanctions, a ramped-up US military presence in the region and more than two dozen\nstrikes on vessels allegedly involved in trafficking drugs\nin the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.\nThe US has also seized sanctioned oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, and Trump ordered a blockade of others in a move that seemed designed to put a tighter chokehold on the South American country’s economy.\nThis is a developing story …\nExplore more on these topics\nVenezuela\nAmericas\nTrump administration\nUS foreign policy\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content",

Alongside the chip, they also released the RP2350 Hacking Challenge: A public call to break the secure boot implementation of the RP2350. This challenge concluded in January 2025 and led to five exciting attacks discovered by different individuals.\nIn this talk, we will provide a technical deep dive in the RP2350 security architecture and highlight the different attacks. Afterwards, we talk about two of the breaks in detail---each of them found by one of the speakers. In particular, we first discuss how fault injection can force an unverified vector boot, completely bypassing secure boot. Then, we showcase how double glitches enable direct readout of sensitive secrets stored in the one-time programmable memory of the RP2350.\nLast, we discuss the mitigation of the attacks implemented in the new revision of the chip and the lessons we learned while solving the RP2350 security challenge. Regardless of chip designer, manufacturer, hobbyist, tinkerer, or hacker: this talk will provide valuable insights for everyone and showcase why security through transparency is awesome.\nThe RP2350 is one of the first generally available microcontrollers with active security-features against fault-injection such as glitch-detectors, the redundancy co-processor, and other pieces to make FI attacks more difficult.\nBut security on paper often does not mean security in real-life. Luckily for us, Raspberry Pi also ran the RP2350 Hacking Challenge: A public bug bounty that has exactly these attacks in-scope. During the hacking challenge 5 different attacks were found on the secure-boot process - one of which was shown at 38C3 by Aedan Cullen.\nIn this talk, we talk about all successful attacks - including laser fault-injection, a reset glitch, and a double-glitch during execution of the bootrom - to show all the different ways in which a chip can be attacked.\nWe also talk about the awesomeness of an open security-ecosystem for chips: Raspberry Pi was very transparent on the findings, and worked with researchers to improve the new revision of the chip.\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\nDownload\nVideo\nAV1\nMP4\nWebM\nDownload 1080p\neng-deu\n501 MB\nDownload 576p\neng-deu\n202 MB\nDownload 1080p\neng-deu\n858 MB\nDownload 576p\neng-deu\n182 MB\nDownload 1080p\neng-deu\n582 MB\nThese files contain multiple languages.\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.

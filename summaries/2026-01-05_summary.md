**Points:** 122 | **Author:** birdculture | **Time:** 2026-01-04T14:30:29 1767537029 | **Comments:** 13

#### Article Summary

Akiman, lead graphic designer on Street Fighter II, discovered a typo "Warrior" instead of "Warrior" just days before the CPS-1 arcade hardware's deadline. To fix it, Akiman used sprite layers to create an 'o' from existing tiles. He then replaced three tiles with others that resembled an 'i', but this created another issue. Finally, using Guile's calves as a template, he sliced the tile to form a dot on top of an 'i', successfully altering "The World Warrier" to "The World Warrior." This story highlights the practical solutions needed in game development under tight deadlines.

### 5. Neurodivergent Brains Build Better Systems (2025)

**URL:** [https://blog.drjoshcsimmons.com/p/how-neurodivergent-brains-build-better](https://blog.drjoshcsimmons.com/p/how-neurodivergent-brains-build-better)
**Points:** 21 | **Author:** user_7832 | **Time:** 2026-01-04T15:08:22 1767539302 | **Comments:** 12

#### Article Summary

The article by Dr. Josh C. Simmons explores how neurodivergent traits can contribute positively to system building, challenging the common pathologization of these traits. Key points include:
1. **Systems Thinking**: Neurodivergent individuals are bottom-up thinkers who collect data before forming hypotheses, making them effective in identifying and solving complex issues.
2. **Hyperfocus and Flow**: They possess intense focus (obsession) that allows for deep work and innovation, exemplified by creating programming languages or composing music within short periods.

These traits, often seen as defects, are highlighted as valuable in building stable infrastructure and efficient systems.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The comments critique an article on neurodiversity, with some defending it and others questioning its fairness and accuracy. Key points include: neurodivergent individuals are not a monolith; neurotypical people struggle with complex problems due to lack of dimensionality reduction; neurodivergent traits can be both advantageous and disadvantageous; and the article oversimplifies the issue, ignoring real-world challenges faced by neurodivergent individuals. The discussion also touches on the presence of problematic leaders in corporate environments and the need for more nuanced understanding and representation of neurodiversity in business settings.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 🤔 MIXED (score: 0.40)

**URL:** [https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)
**Points:** 648 | **Author:** lylejantzi3rd | **Time:** 2026-01-05T11:51:42 1767613902 | **Comments:** 296

#### Article Summary

The author criticizes macOS Tahoe's new icons for being cluttered and ineffective. They argue icons should differentiate items to aid quick finding, but Tahoe adds them universally, reducing visual distinction. The critique highlights a lack of consistency: common functions like "New," "Save," and "Close" have varying icons across Apple's own apps, confusing users. Internal app inconsistencies are also noted, where toolbar and menu icons for the same action differ. Overall, the icons are deemed poorly designed, failing in both clarity and coherence.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The comments criticize Apple's "Liquid Glass" UI in macOS Tahoe for being a wasteful, inconsistent, and poorly executed blend of flat design and skeuomorphism that adds visual clutter without usability benefits. Users report it is particularly problematic on mobile, causing a cramped interface. Broader complaints include amateurish design rules (like unnecessary icons), technical bugs, permission issues, and a decline in Apple's software quality and reliability. Many attribute this to a loss of strong design leadership post-Steve Jobs or Jony Ive, suggesting the company prioritizes visual novelty over functional, user-centered design.

### 3. Cigarette smoke effect using shaders

**URL:** [https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/javascript/three-js/shaders/shaders-103-smoke](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/javascript/three-js/shaders/shaders-103-smoke)
**Points:** 31 | **Author:** bradwoodsio | **Time:** 2026-01-05T11:32:58 1767612778 | **Comments:** 4

#### Article Summary

This tutorial explains how to create a cigarette smoke effect in three.js using shader materials. The process involves rendering a plane with a custom shader, applying a Perlin noise texture to generate randomness, and mapping that texture onto the geometry. Key steps include passing UV coordinates from the vertex to the fragment shader to sample the texture and using the texture's grayscale values to determine the fragment's final color. The guide is intended for developers already familiar with three.js fundamentals.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

Three users discuss a visual effect, likely smoke, in a game context. Reactordev suggests it's typically a prerendered animated texture, though modern games might use a GPU particle system. Lelandfe expresses a wish for a fluid dynamics simulation and describes a personal technique using a framebuffer and velocity to create vortices. Orphea compliments the effect and unique site design, then humorously notes the unusually narrow scrollbar as an "interesting choice."

### 5. Decorative Cryptography

**URL:** [https://www.dlp.rip/decorative-cryptography](https://www.dlp.rip/decorative-cryptography)
**Points:** 120 | **Author:** todsacerdoti | **Time:** 2026-01-05T08:29:38 1767601778 | **Comments:** 30

#### Article Summary

The article examines the Linux kernel feature `TCG_TPM2_HMAC`, which aims to protect TPM bus communications from active and passive interposer attacks using HMAC and encryption. It notes the feature's limitation: as a kernel feature, it cannot protect earlier boot stages like firmware or the bootloader, which must be implicitly trusted. The threat model involves an adversary snooping or tampering with the TPM bus to spoof devices, modify measurements, disclose secrets (like disk encryption keys), or cause denial of service. While the feature adds encryption overhead, its value lies in securing kernel-to-TPM transactions against bus-level attacks during boot.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The discussion centers on encryption security and hardware trust. A commenter critiques Apple's iMessage encryption, noting that despite being end-to-end encrypted, Apple conducts on-device content scans that contact its servers. This leads to a broader debate on "threat model gerrymandering" and the security of hardware roots of trust. Participants discuss the need for integrated Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) within CPUs, referencing IBM POWER9's early advancements and current shortcomings in mainstream processors. Concerns are raised about trusting CPU vendors themselves. The conversation also touches on the perceived futility of software encryption and references past issues with PGP, while noting that hardware-based security always has vulnerabilities, differing only in the effort required to exploit them.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 😐 NEUTRAL (score: 0.55)

*Comments are primarily technical and analytical with minimal emotional content. Some positive appreciation for clever phrasing ('threat model gerrymandering' quote) and IBM POWER9 features, balanced by skepticism about security implementations and corporate practices. Overall tone is thoughtful discussion rather than strongly positive or negative.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 😐 NEUTRAL (score: 0.50)

### 3. Why does a least squares fit appear to have a bias when applied to simple data?

**URL:** [https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/674129/why-does-a-linear-least-squares-fit-appear-to-have-a-bias-when-applied-to-simple](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/674129/why-does-a-linear-least-squares-fit-appear-to-have-a-bias-when-applied-to-simple)
**Points:** 85 | **Author:** azeemba | **Time:** 2026-01-04T20:25:30 1767558330 | **Comments:** 20

#### Article Summary

The text discusses why a standard linear least-squares fit can appear biased when applied to correlated data, as it minimizes vertical errors rather than aligning with the data's main spread. The author compares this to the principal eigenvector from PCA, which points in the direction of maximum variance and better captures the data's central orientation. This difference arises because least squares assumes one variable is independent, breaking symmetry, while PCA treats both symmetrically. The example uses generated correlated data to illustrate the contrast.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

This discussion clarifies that ordinary least squares (OLS) regression assumes noise only in the Y variable, while methods like total least squares or PCA account for noise in both X and Y. Contributors note that Deming regression is a preferred alternative when X has error, and explain that OLS minimizes vertical distances, leading to a different slope than modeling horizontal distances. Several comments emphasize that OLS remains unbiased for predicting Y given X even if X is noisy, and its validity relies on error properties like constant variance, not strictly a Gaussian distribution. Visual discrepancies in fits are expected and do not necessarily indicate a poor model.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 😐 NEUTRAL (score: 0.50)

*Comments are primarily technical, educational, and explanatory in nature, focusing on statistical concepts without strong emotional content. Tone is analytical and collaborative, with minor meta-criticism from one user.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 👍 AGREE (score: 0.85)

*All commenters support the article's explanation that least squares appears biased because it assumes noise only in Y, while PCA treats X and Y symmetrically. Comments expand on this with examples, clarifications, and related methods.*

**Key Points:**

- Least squares minimizes vertical errors assuming noise only in Y, while PCA minimizes perpendicular distances assuming noise in both X and Y
- The apparent bias arises from the asymmetric error assumption in least squares
- Total Least Squares or Deming regression are alternatives when both variables have noise

##### Main Discussion Topics

- linear regression
- ordinary least squares
- total least squares
- Deming regression
- error modeling

### 5. Linear Address Spaces: Unsafe at any speed

**URL:** [https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3534854](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3534854)
**Points:** 100 | **Author:** nithssh | **Time:** 2025-12-31T07:57:53 1767167873 | **Comments:** 54

#### Article Summary

The article argues that linear address spaces in modern computing are fundamentally insecure and inefficient. It highlights how this model enables memory corruption attacks, complicates security features like ASLR, and wastes memory resources. The author advocates for a shift toward capability-based addressing, which would improve security by design and offer better memory utilization.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The discussion centers on why linear addresses persist despite object-oriented programming. Key points: early object-oriented hardware like iAPX 432 failed, while linear addresses succeeded due to performance, backward compatibility, and flexibility. Virtual memory provides security and isolation, but lacks fine-grained object-level protection. Some argue tagged memory or new models could improve safety, though linear memory efficiently supports various object models. Overall, practical concerns like deployment speed and cost outweigh theoretical elegance.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 🤔 MIXED (score: 0.45)

*Comments are predominantly technical and argumentative, with a negative tone in debates about historical failures (e.g., iAPX 432) and dismissive critiques of the original post. Some positive engagement exists (e.g., interest in a semantic IDE), but overall sentiment leans negative due to contentious disagreement and skepticism.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 👎 DISAGREE (score: 0.30)

*Most commenters challenge the article's premise, arguing linear address spaces persist due to practical advantages like performance, compatibility, and flexibility, not fundamental insecurity.*

**Key Points:**

- Linear addresses enable performance and compatibility, outweighing safety concerns

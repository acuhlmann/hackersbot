Any creation that uses elements from the public domain is also, automatically, in the public domain.\n3\n. Activate retroactively: When the first book in a series (for example) gets into the public domain, then the whole series (and franchise) becomes public domain.\n(3) depends on what the initial rule is for something to get into the public domain.\nP.S: It's a thought experiment, not an actual \"let's implement it now!\" thing.",

A few years ago I sent a mail to Planet Money in what I thought would be an interesting hook but never got a response:\n\"Hi Planet Money, today is public domain day. I see that Fritz Lang's classic Metropolis is now in the \"public domain.\" I was curious what that meant at a practical level for a German language silent film.\nIf Planet Money Movies wanted to release their own version of Metropolis, how would they do it? Can you just go to Amazon, buy the Blu Ray, and somehow release your own? What about the anti-piracy measures on the Blu Ray? What about the work that Transit Film did in restoring the film from the original negative? Does that count as some sort of newly original work? It's a silent film and a foreign film. How does the soundtrack and translation work?\nIf you have to make a new copy from the original reels, what if someone is hoarding them? Does that mean you could buy all the copies and prevent someone from releasing a public domain version?\"",

A new translation is also copyrightable; essentially it's only the \"original elements\" that enter the public domain.

I've seen claims that they couldn't get a license to do a video game based on the movie, so being inspired by the soundtrack was a workaround.

          "text": "I really like this subthread:\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46118808\n> I love the original 14+14. I’ve heard proposals for exponentially growing fees to allow truly big enterprises to stay copywritten longer, like 14+14 with filing and $100, another 14 for $100,000, another 14 for $10M, another 14 for $100M. That would allow 70 years or protection for a few key pieces of IP that are worth it, which seems like an okay trade off?\nI've always been a fan of this, but here's a great detraction:\n> I think would diminish independent author rights. Quite often, a novel will become popular only decades after publishing, and I think the author should be able to profit on the fruits of their labour without wealthy corporations tarnishing their original IP, or creating TV shows and the link with no reperations to the creator. Fantasy book are a good example. A Games of Thrones was first released in 1996 but had middling success. It was only after 2011 that the series exploded in popularity. Good Omens main peak was ~15 years after release. Hell, some books like Handmaiden's Tale were published in 1985 but only reached their peak in 2010. IP law was originally to protect artist and authors from the wealthy, but now it seems to have the opposite intent.\nThis is a very solid point. Works sometimes only become popular decades after their initial release.\nPerhaps a way to protect individual artists would be to limit the number of copyrights held by a particular entity. The more you aggregate or hold on to, the steeper the cost to maintain the copyright. I'm sure loopholes like \"we're a holding company of holding companies\" might be invented to counter this, but if we tied this to real people rather than corporations it might work.\nCopyrights shouldn't last longer than humans.",

I think that GRR Martin's books would be giving him sizeable profit, even if someone else were able to make GoT fanfiction in the same universe, and the GoT TV Series would still have to pay him to use the more recent copyrighted books, not just the settings and characters from the original.\nThere is already intrinsic value in having written the original work, and that intrinsic value will make you the best person to consult on a TV adaption or make sequels, even if the original work is public domain and in theory anyone could adapt it.\nIf an author makes something 20 years ago, doesn't build on the universe any more beyond that, and is unable to compete in their own universe they built against other authors once it goes public domain and becomes popular, well, then tough luck for the author.\nLet's look at how this works for software: every piece of open-source software out there is something that in theory another company could take and sell as their own. Red Hat Linux is Open Source, so sure anyone can make their own... and yet Red Hat can sell consulting services and new versions of it because they're the only group with proper expertise there.\n> limit the number of copyrights held by a particular entity\nEntities are unfortunately quite easy to fake and difficult to define in a fool-proof way.\nIf you can still license copyrights, then holding companies would become the norm. Like, right now LucasArts owns StarWars, and LucasArts is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney, but if we had a limit on how many copyrights an entity can hold, Disney wouldn't acquire LucasArts, and would instead pay for an exclusive copyright license.",

On this year's Public Domain Day (which falls each January 1st) we welcome, in lots of countries around the world, the words of Wallace Stevens, Thomas Mann, Hannah Arendt, and Albert Einstein, and in the US a bevy of brilliant books including William Faulkner’s\nAs I Lay Dying\n, Langston Hughes’\nNot Without Laughter\n, Agatha Christie’s\nThe Murder at the Vicarage\n, and, in their original German, Robert Musil’s\nThe Man Without Qualities\nand Hermann Hesse’s\nNarcissus and Goldmund\n.\nDue to differing copyright laws around the world, there is no one single public domain, but there are three main types of copyright term for historical works which cover most cases. For these three systems, newly entering the public domain today are:\nworks by people who died in 1955\n, for countries with a copyright term of “life plus 70 years” (relevant in UK, most of the EU, and South America);\nworks by people who died in 1975\n, for countries with a term of “life plus 50 years” (relevant to most of Africa and Asia);\nfilms\nand\nbooks\n(incl. artworks featured) published in 1929 (relevant solely to the United States).\nSome of you may have been following\nour advent-style countdown calendar\nwhich revealed day-by-day through December our highlights for these new public domain entrants. The last window was opened yesterday, and while such a format was fun for the slow reveal, for the sake of a good gorgeable list we’ve exploded the calendar out into a digestible array below. Enjoy!\nEntering the public domain in the US\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\nWilliam Faulkner –\nAs I Lay Dying\nAs I Lay Dying\nis a Southern Gothic novel by American author William Faulkner, consistently ranked among the best novels of the 20th century. The title is derived from William Marris’s 1925 translation of Homer’s\nOdyssey\n, referring to the similar themes of both works.\nThe novel traces the story of the death of Addie Bundren and her poor, rural family’s quest to honor her wish to be buried in her hometown of Jefferson, Mississippi, as well as the motives—noble or selfish—they show on the journey. It uses a stream-of-consciousness writing technique and varying chapter lengths, and is narrated by 15 different characters over 59 chapters.\nFaulkner said that he wrote the novel from midnight to 4:00 a.m. over the course of six weeks and that he did not change a word of it. He spent the first eight hours of his twelve-hour shift at the University of Mississippi Power House shoveling coal or directing other works and the remaining four hours handwriting his manuscript on unlined onionskin paper.\nAs I Lay Dying\nrepresents a progenitor of the Southern Renaissance, reflecting on being, existence, and other existential metaphysics of everyday life, and helped to solidify Faulkner’s reputation as a pioneer, like James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, of stream of consciousness.

It is the first book in the\nSwallows and Amazons\nseries, followed by\nSwallowdale\n.\nSet in the summer of 1929 in England’s Lake District, the book relates the outdoor adventures and play of two families of children. These involve sailing, camping, fishing, exploration and piracy. The Walker children (John, Susan, Titty and Roger) are staying at a farm near a lake in the Lake District of England, during the school holidays. They sail a borrowed dinghy named\nSwallow\nand meet the Blackett children (Nancy and Peggy), who sail a dinghy named\nAmazon\n. When the children meet, they agree to join forces against a common enemy – the Blacketts’ uncle Jim Turner whom they call “Captain Flint” (after the parrot in\nTreasure Island\n).\nThe book was inspired by a summer spent by Ransome teaching the children of his friends, the Altounyans, to sail. At the time, Ransome had been working as a journalist with the\nManchester Guardian\n, but decided to become a full-time author rather than go abroad as a foreign correspondent. Three of the Altounyan children’s names are adopted directly for the Walker family. However, later in life Ransome tried to downplay the Altounyan connections, changing the initial dedication of\nSwallows and Amazons\nand writing a new foreword which gave other sources.

The report at hand seems to affect a very limited number of users (given the lack of reports and information about them). There are lots of X meme posts about Ghostty in the macOS \"Force Close\" window using a massive amount of RAM but that isn't directly useful because that window also reports all the RAM _child processes_ are using (e.g. if you run a command in your shell that consumes 100 GB of RAM, macOS reports it as Ghostty using 100 GB of RAM). And the window by itself also doesn't tell us what you were doing in Ghostty. It farms good engagement, though.\n2. We've run Ghostty on Linux under Valgrind in a variety of configurations (the full GUI), we run all of Ghostty's unit tests under Valgrind in CI for every commit, and we've run Ghostty on macOS with the Xcode Instruments leak checker in a variety of configurations and we haven't yet been able to find any leaks. Both of these run fully clean. So, the \"easy\" tools can't find it.\n3. Following point 1 and 2, no maintainer familiar with the codebase has ever seen leaky behavior. Some of us run a build of Ghostty, working full time in a terminal, for weeks, and memory is stable.\n4. Our Discord has ~30K users, and within it, we only have one active user who periodically gets a large memory issue. They haven't been able to narrow this down to any specific reproduction and they aren't familiar enough with the codebase to debug it themselves, unfortunately. They're trying!\nTo be clear, I 100% believe that there is some kind of leak affecting some specific configuration of users. That's why the discussion is open and we're soliciting input. I even spent about an hour today on the latest feedback (posted earlier today) trying to use that information to narrow it down. No dice, yet.\nIf anyone has more info, we'd love to find this. :)",

This may not be the only goal; one may be to have fewer issues raised in total. But there may be several advantages, as well as disadvantages with that approach - it is simply a trade-off.\nIn particular when I maintain an open source project, I have a lack of time in general so I need to move quickly. I actually don't mind issue discussions on my project, but people can not expect me to invest a lot of time into managing all of those; whether this is a discussion or an issue directly, is not so important, but I know that some project owners don't like open issues that remain open for years. It is kind of a difference in philosophy here.\nOne trade off is that I am not so likely to get involved in such a project. I may start a discussion, but in general I am very chaotic and may never follow up on discussions I started, simply due to lack of time, too many things to do, forgetting too much too (I do keep notes locally, but these files just keep on growing!).",

There are users out there reporting bugs that don't know ANYTHING about our stack, but are great AI drivers and producing some high quality issue reports.\nThis person (linked below) was experiencing Ghostty crashes and took it upon themselves to use AI to write a python script that can decode our crash files, match them up with our dsym files, and analyze the codebase for attempting to find the root cause, and extracted that into an Agent Skill.\nThey then came into Discord, warned us they don't know Zig at all, don't know macOS dev at all, don't know terminals at all, and that they used AI, but that they thought critically about the issues and believed they were real and asked if we'd accept them. I took a look at one, was impressed, and said send them all.\nThis fixed 4 real crashing cases that I was able to manually verify and write a fix for from someone who -- on paper -- had no fucking clue what they were talking about. And yet, they drove an AI with expert skill.\nI want to call out that in addition to driving AI with expert skill, they navigated the terrain with expert skill as well. They didn't just toss slop up on our repo. They came to Discord as a human, reached out as a human, and talked to other humans about what they've done. They were careful and thoughtful about the process.\nPeople like this give me hope for what is possible. But it really, really depends on high quality people like this. Most today -- to continue the analogy -- are unfortunately driving like a teenager who has only driven toy go-karts.\"\n\"Examples:\nhttps://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions?discussio...\n\"",

You know how to save for your children from day one and what to teach them.\nBut the thing about time is true and doubly so when it comes to grandparents. First of all if you live around your family and they can help out, it's an invaluable rock to lean on, and of course if you waited the grandparents are going to be too old to really help. But what's worse, is your kids will probably know them for a very short time if they even remember them when they grow up.\nThe thing about \"being ready\" is nonsense because you can't be ready. You don't understand what a massive gift and blessing it is to have children, and also how everything changes. You can't be ready because you just can't understand it before it happens. So waiting for the perfect time is useless. If you know want children at some point, just do it.",

Each and every person. We are the unique meaning generators of the universe, like stars emit photons we emit complex meaning, there is no entity we have observed that has explained to the universe the how and why of bird flight, we generated the how and why of that, we are meaning generating organs of the universe bootstrapped by simpler meaning in rna and dna and each one of us is rare.\nComplex meaning generation, storage and emission is still in it's infancy from our empirical observations we can't predict how far into the future meaning generation will reach or what it will accomplish, we can't ex ante predict how important we are, no one can tell us we won't be very important to the casual chain of the universe, it simply cannot be computed ahead of time.\nAs a child I read the book version of A Baker's Dozen, a true story about an efficiency expert with a heart defect that had 12 children and dies at the end while calling his wife.\nEach person generates unique meaning in the universe and the one thing we get to do is decide what our unique meaning exploration path is, no person is guaranteed to see any time with their kids, guaranteed to want to have kids, guaranteed to have a kid they enjoy being around. Decide what you intrinsically find meaningful and generate meaning, the random forrest requires the diversity of search/creation paths.",

      "content": "Photo illustration, tombstone header photo dee E. Warenycia, Roseville, CA, baby carriage CTK via AP Images\nIn April,\nin a small town on a small island in a small string of islands trailing down from the main part of Japan, the world’s then-oldest person died. Nabi Tajima was 117 years old—the last surviving human being born in the 19th century.\nMaybe the year 1900 sounds far away, to you. It comes closer. My father was born in 1940. Right now, I am 47 years old. Everyone who was 47 years old when my father was born is now dead. All of them. That entire group of middle-aged people, who made up the adult world when my father was a child, is gone.\nMy father is dead, now, too. He smoked, and it shortened his life. But I lived with him, grew up with him. I was an adult with him. We drank coffee at the dining room table together, read the newspaper, talked on the phone. He sat and talked with my firstborn son when he was little. He held my second-born, as a baby, while he could. The older boy remembers him.\nThe younger boy is seven now. When my father was a boy of seven, Nabi Tajima was 47. I keep sliding the numbers around, and as I do, they shove each other out of the way. The people don’t all fit.\n***\nTwelve years ago, I had not thought about any of this at all. I was 35. My wife would soon be pregnant, for the first time. We had dated for a good long while, been engaged for a good long while, been married for a good long while. We had bought a house in the suburbs and then we had sold it and moved overseas. It was all a sensibly paced series of life events, at appropriate-seeming times.\nIt did not occur to me, in any real way, that as we did this, we were spending down a limited resource. In our social world, in our cultural class, at our point in history, people are brought up to take the opposite view, to structure their lives as if time were something a person accumulated. One is wary of getting married too soon, of having children too young. Adulthood is a condition to enter cautiously and gradually.\nFrom certain angles, this breeds disdain—penniless millennials eating avocado toast, forty-year-old men skateboarding in sneakers and t-shirts, slovenly and undisciplined generations refusing to commit to lives and careers. But the complaining is halfhearted, a way for the older cohort to convince itself the younger cohort might be safely held at bay. And to point out the shortcomings of adult-aged people is, at bottom, to argue that maturity is something rarefied. The figure of the kidult exists as a warning that you should not move on to the next step until you’re certain you’re ready.\nBut this idea of certainty is a sham, a distraction, something to turn your attention away from the only truly certain thing, which is that your time will run out. If you intend to have children, but you don’t intend to have them just yet, you are not banking extra years as a person who is still too young to have children. You are subtracting years from the time you will share the world with your children.\nAll our conversations about choices and priorities and life decisions are held in the shadow of the great constraint. The closest the discussion usually comes to it is the subject of women’s anatomy, the aging of eggs, the decline of female fertility. Sometimes, for the broad-minded, there may be some mention of the fading quality of men’s sperm, as well. The possibility that it might not happen at all—that a particular body might not be able, or might fall ill, or might die first—is almost unspeakable, and for planning purposes goes unspoken.\nInstead, life and the making of more life appears as a technical problem; where the body’s ability to stall falters, cryogenics can take over. Perhaps zygotes can be spun up from ordinary DNA. Science is doing its best to push back the limits. Look to the wealthy and the entitled and see the future: Mick Jagger just sired a baby at age 73.\nNow look to the future: when that baby turns 10, Mick Jagger will be 83. When that baby turns 20, Mick Jagger will be 93. When that baby turns 30, 40, 45—Mick Jagger will be almost certainly dead, all but definitely dead, unquestionably dead.\nAs the child of a spectacularly wealthy man, Mick Jagger’s baby will surely be provided for. But not by its dad, not in person.\n***\nDid we choose the age at which we would have children? What does it mean to choose? We use the language of autonomy to avoid thinking about powers that shape our existence. Our civilization is remarkably hostile to the needs of life, from the helplessness of babyhood to the frailty of old age. The system is set up for healthy, productive, independent individuals, and one absorbs the lesson that one should try to stay in this class as long and as securely as one can.\nSo we wait until we are ready. There are good reasons to wait, or reasons that appear to be good once you accept the underlying terms. My children have not had to live with parents who are working 15-hour days, the way",

A personal story highlights the emotional and social costs of a decade-long struggle with infertility, including lost time with children and isolation from peers.

Other points include the importance of grandparents, the uniqueness of each family's path, and the generational loss of the \"adult world\" from one's own childhood.

A lot of the discussion about web design in the 90s came about as a result of people coming from a traditional publishing background and really struggling to do what they wanted with the web medium, so to me it sort of hearks back to that a bit, does a good job of embracing some parts of that older aesthetic, but works well with modern web capabilities.

You're reducing their choices to a question of whether they intended to be popular or to court criticism, flattening the conversation into one about social media credit, and completely discrediting the idea that they had true intent beyond likes and points.

The quintessential example for me was its usage in US anti-desegregation rhetoric in the 1960s, alongside its resurgence in the anti-DEI movement today -- demanding that no one discuss our shared institutions is too often an endorsement of them, rather than an honest effort to focus on something else.\n\"toward the left\" aside, it's always a little frustrating to read the ubiquitous \"this place sucks\" comments on here and Reddit. I have tons of problems with HN--both petty (markdown when??) and fundamental (SV/PE has metastasized in a discomforting way...)--but I'm still here because I love it, and think it's one of the best communities the internet has to offer.\nSpecific critiques of specific people or ideas are always welcome, but comments like \"everyone here is curmudgeonly\" just makes me wonder why they bother to log on in the first place...",

I think humans have a hard time identifying how much of their feelings of nostalgia are based in reality.\nMaybe the platform has not actually changed in the ways people fear, and instead, peoples' opinions on what is interesting, important, or valuable has changed?\nSince this thread has been discussing politics-adjacent things, let's consider Senator John Fetterman from the United States. Mr. Fetterman is notably different today from when he first started his campaign, regarding what he believes is important and valuable. (Mr. Fetterman suffered a stroke, which is suspected to have brought about personality changes and shifts in political ideology.)\n---\nI think we, as individuals, should always be focusing our first line of questioning on how _we're_ changing, rather than trying to figure out how the world, or the zeitgeist, or Hacker News, etc. is changing.\nSometimes we outgrow things that we hold dear, and instead of accepting that it's not really the place for us anymore and moving on to a different environment, we try to shape our current environment around our new personality by instituting new rules or adding new features.",

Things can become progressively worse over long periods of time, it's not an instant change that can only happen once.\nAnother context where I often see this \"argument\" is major Windows versions. People rightfully say they want to stay on Windows 10 because 11 is objectively worse in many ways, and someone jumps in to say \"you said the same about 7 to 10\" as if it's some sort of gotcha. Both complaints can be right, each new version can be worse than the last.\nRight now, we have at least one aspect in which HN has become objectively worse in the past years: AI-generated content. It didn't exist a decade ago, so good luck using that \"argument\" there.

The social contract is sort of falling off in most countries. So there is a nostalgia for the previous social contracts and the things which were with them like the old internet because to be honest the current monopolistic internet does influence with things like lobbying and chrony capitalism to actively break that social contract via corrupt schemes.\nPeople want to do something about it, but speaking as a young guy, we didn't witness the old era so we ourselves are frustrated too but most don't create manifesto's due to it and try to find hobbies or similar things as we try to find the meaning of our life and role in the world\nBut for the people who have witnessed the old internet, they have that nostalgia to end up to and that's partially why they end up creating a manifesto of sorts themselves.\nThe reality of the situation to me feels like things are slipping up in multiple areas and others.\nDo you really feel that the govt. has best interests for you, the average citizen?\nChances are no, So this is probably why liberterian philosophy is really spreading and the idea of freedom itself.\nHeck I joined linux and the journey behind it all because I played a game and it had root level kernel access and I realized that there really was no way to effectively prove that it wasn't gone (it was chinese company [riot] so I wasn't sure if I wanted it)\nI ended up looking at linux and then just watched enough videos until I convinced myself to use it one day and just switched. But Most people are really land-locked into the Microsoft ecosystem, even tiny nuances can be enough for some.\nusing Linux was the reason why I switched from trying to go from finance to computer science. I already knew CS but I loved finance too but In the end I ended up picking CS because I felt like there were chances of making real impact myself which were more unique to me than say chartered accountant.\nSo my point is, I am not sure if I would even be here if I had even the slightest of nuances. Heck, I am not even much of a gamer but my first distro was nobara linux which focused on gaming because I was worried about gaming or worried about wine or smth. So I had switched to nobara.\nLooking now, I say to others oh just use this or that and other things and see it as the most obvious decisions sometimes but by writing this comment, I just wanted to say that change can be scary sometimes.\n> Then there is the paradox of freedom to deal with, specifically if everyone is free to change anything they like to be the way they like it, other people will hate it and the entire system will be \"bad.\" But for everyone to use the same basic frame work, and the dislike for the lack of freedom will be a common cause that builds community.\nI would say let the man have his freedom. I would consider having more choices to be less of a burden than few choices in most occasions. Of course one's mind feels that there is a sweet spot but in longevity I feel like its the evolution of ideas and more ideas means more the competition and we will see more innovation as such.",

That usually signals polite disagreement or intellectual one‑upmanship\" LOL)\nWoah homie, watch out for the model which is trained on reddit comments dataset to talk about intellectual one-upmanship xD\nAlso another thing but holy shit, LLM's are sycophantic man, it tries uses big words itself to show how the person has intellectual one-upmanship while cozying you up by saying practical design aphorism.\nLike I agree with both of you guys and there's nuance but I am pretty sure that nobody's tryna sound intellectual hopefully.\nSorry for turning this into a rant about LLM's being sycophantic but man I tried today watching big bang and asked it if sheldon and raj were better duo in more common about physics (theorist and astrophysicist) since I was watching a episode where they both have dark matter in common and chatgpt agreed\nThen I just felt the sycophancy in my heart so I opened up a new thread and I think I used the same prompt and changed it to sheldon and leonard and it ended up saying yes again.\nThe problem felt so annoying to me that I ended up looking at a sycophancy index being frustrated of sorts and wrote a lengthy ddg prompt lol to find this\nhttps://www.glazebench.com/\nWe really don't need more yes man's in our lives and honestly I will take up a less intelligent model than a sycophantic one. So I am curious what your guys opinion are on it too as sometimes I use LLM's as a search engines to familiarize myself with things I don't know and I am lately feeling it will just say yes to anything even silly ideas so I would never know what's the truth matter of the reality ykwim?",

It would be totally useless and absurd, but I could (given I have no specific perception-related medical conditions) !\nWe saw the web become a repetition of the same design, and while it IS good design in our \"minimalism\" addicted brains, I am pretty sure stumbling upon weiiiiird websites makes us great good sometimes, so much that maybe we also start to think about the absurdity of our standards : we arrived to the point in the \"lie\" where we identify this specific style as \"the shape\" of our perception, and yes : it become invisible to us, and is good design, but also it is a bit depressing.\nMy window manager and my emacs/vim/terminal configuration aren't what I call good design. They are highly readable but stratosphere-reaching levels of kitsch (yes ! I WANT to cosplay and feel as if I was writing code for aliens or to fight the matrix at work, and yes that's a bit cringe but at least I am honest with myself).\nI don't wish the world and internet to be \"more like that\" and am ok with the actual state of design.

This single fact opens the floodgates to noise, spam, and irrelevance at an unprecedented scale.\nThe core problem is that the average consumer cannot easily distinguish between these two fundamentally different universes. Loud, low-effort content often masquerades as significance, while quiet, honest, and carefully produced work is overlooked.

You’d be shocked at the volume of this still being written by retirees on Blogger (no shade, it’s good to have a hobby, but goddamn there are a lot of you).\nThe slice of “things an average person might plausibly care to look at” was vanishingly small.\nThere are no spam filters, mods, or ways to report abuse when you run your content mill on your own domain.\nLike you, I was somewhat surprised by this result.

There are some things which can be done to better sooth the private forums.\nLike to me especially signing up to each and every forum and then waiting to be accepted by a person feels good but has tons of friction and has some stress attached because you never know how strict the community is as well, it might take a day or two, perhaps this is the reason why we got the dumpster fire of mega internet forums called reddit or twitter of sorts\nTo me, federation feels better in this context since I can still have a single identity of sorts across multiple forums and you got better idea / ways to filter as well if need be\nAnother thing I feel about private forums where users have to wait for permission signing up is that I feel like something even as simple as having a cute cat or cute apple LOL or anything relaxing could make it less stressful for people to join. I assume its impact would be few but it would leave a deeper impact on those who do want to join.",

Whenever people talk about leaving platforms, the immediate rebuttal is \"discoverability\" or \"reach\" as if it's self-evident that pursuing an audience is inherently good. It's rarely defended; it's just presumed.\nThis is often smuggled in under the language of \"network effects,\" as though the relationship were mutual. But \"audience\" is fundamentally one-directional. It turns participation into performance.\nI think a lot of internet nostalgia is really grief for a time when you could participate without being on stage. Sure, you wanted lots of people to read your blog, but we did have an era when posting didn't implicitly ask: how big is your following, how well did this travel, did it work.\nToday, the \"successful\" participants (the successful audience-builders) are called \"creators\", while everyone else (who is also creating, just without large-scale traction) is categorized as lesser or invisible. You can write a blog post, a tweet, a Reddit thread; you have undeniably created something. Yet without an audience, you haven't achieved the status that now defines digital legitimacy.\nWhat I miss is a participation model that didn't say: audience or perish.",

Text social networks are the most common way this happens to me. But the other common failure mode was with food.\nWithout the retatrutide dose I'm on I frequently consume large amounts of food. I love apples, and blueberries, and chicken and rice. I can easily eat an entire Costco bag of Envy Apples at a stretch. Inevitably, I regret this once I have exited my fugue state of food consumption. So why do I do it? My behaviour on retatrutide is far superior at getting me both total content and joy (in the sense of area-under-the-curve rather than point-in-time).\nThis concept has been explored for a long time[0]. The earliest documented I know of is the concept of Akrasia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia\nfrom the Greek philosophers. But I think any notion of utility must build in the notion of regret and perhaps the bicameral mind and perhaps also the notion of non-rationality. My utility functions for the things I do are not time-translation invariant, therefore I think any model that optimizes for greater content and greater joy must necessarily involve temporally non-local terms. I don't yet have a strong model of this.\nBut we know this is common to many mental disorders. Part of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is an interruption of some mental pattern. My wife and I have a game we find amusing to play when we want to overrule the other's temporally local preferences: we challenge the other to a game of rock-paper-scissors to see whether the countermanding applies. When she exercises it, I frequently find that even if I win the momentary desire has passed.\ntl;dr: Utility functions have different values depending on the temporal stride they take\n0: Recently, Elon Musk claimed that the aim for Twitter should be \"unregretted user minutes\". Sadly, despite this stated aim, I found that his changes decreased these and increased regret so I had to stop using his platform. I agree with the notion of maximizing (value - regret) expressed in some abstract form, however.",

Unless we understand how those complex systems work, we cannot change anything. We end up with cargo cult thinking. You need to understand the function that produces the result.\nWhy does the internet function the way it does? It is really pretty simple. The internet is primarily characterized by very-high-volume-very-low-value transactions.\nHow much does it cost to send an email? When I send a real letter, I buy a stamp $0.78. So if I can send an email instead, it will save me a lot of money. You can try to calculate how many email transactions you can provide on one VPS costing $5.00 per month.\nHere is a great business opportunity! You sell people email stamps at $0.01 per letter for 10k bytes. Cool. And 1,000,000 people each buy 10 stamps. Wow. That is a lot of money for your $5/month VPS, right?\nBut how do you get the money? You need to find a way for the one million people to each send you a dime. You cannot do it. If they put a dime in envelope and mail it to you, it will cost them $0.78. Etc.\nSo you have another idea. Why not let scammers include details of their scam in all emails send and they pay for the email. Oops, I should have used the term \"advertisers\". Now the people who email pay nothing and the scamm.... oops advertisers pay for the cost.\nAnd you surprisingly find many, many people and corporations from all over the world are eager to exploit, oops target with advertising users.

But only ever a very small fraction of society was going to be able to make and consume that stuff.\nThis new internet is much more accessible and it occasionally produces diamonds of culture, you just have to know where to look.\nSo no, I don’t think any amount of decentralized protocols or tooling or any technology really can change this. I think this trend is set and will continue, and I’ve had to learn to be more open minded to how I perceive internet content.\nNo one is going to make personal websites or change their behavior in a major way.\nLook, you can still sign up for free web hosting and make an HTML page and tell your friends. There are still people that do this. But it’s naturally eclipsed by these other methods of much easier content sharing.\nThe point is the content itself, not the packaging. Just get over the shape of the packaging and enjoy.",

Most pressingly, I don't think any of the three show an example like that of the automobile, whose ubiquity is\nmandatory\n!\n1. Describing \"proponents [of the industrial revolution]\" as some external group seems pretty absurd, and gives the rest of the piece an unsettling Kazinsky vibe. Yes, of course there are a variety of problems in the world related to the textile industry, that's obvious. But blaming \"wage theft\" and \"over consumption\" on the technology itself just seems absurd. You can still buy handmade clothes, and due to transportation-enabled specialization, they'd almost definitely be much cheaper and higher quality than they would've been in 1725!\n2. Citing a 256 page report on antibiotic resistance[1] with no page number for the vague claim that they were overprescribed to some extent in the 1950s-70s is just plain rude! Regardless, there's no economic system forcing antibiotics on you; if you really wanted to for some reason, you could even\nsave\nmoney by refusing them. Rather, the basic realities of human health are what makes them so ubiquitous, in the same way that they make food or hand washing ubiquitous.\n3. This summary of the issues with LEO internet satellites is just way,\nway\noversimplified -- the most egregious part being the implication that it is now \"impossible to use earth-based sensors... to learn about space\"! More fundamentally, equating LEO telecommunications with astrophysics research because they both involve things above our heads is goofy and misleading. Even more fundamentally--and to return to my overall point--there's no attempt to even vaguely gesture at a \"radical monopoly\" here! It's fair to say that the vast, vast majority of people only interact with LEO satellites when using GPS, which, again, is absolutely not mandatory.\nAnd, finally, the web:\nThe web is no exception to this pattern. A vision of interoperability, accessibility, and usability, the World Wide Web was first conceived in 1989... But the proliferation of access and ultimate social requirement of access has spawned countless troubles for human society...\nI hope it's clear how \"technologies come with downsides\" is a much more vague, obvious, and less-useful point than the Radical Monopoly thesis.\nIt’s an industrial, production-minded way of approaching a discipline that has all the hallmarks of being a great craft\nI feel like the word \"craft\" is pretty telling here, as it strongly implies a break from the marketplace. If you don't like \"industrial\" websites, maybe take up issue with the concept of industry instead?\nHand-coded, syndicated, and above all personal websites are exemplary\nI love personal websites, as do we all. The idea that more than, say, 5% of the population would be interested in them without\nradical\nchanges to our work-life schedules is a tad absurd tho, is it not? You really think the millions of people who are happily sharing AI-generated images of Jesus statues made out of plastic bottles on Facebook could be tempted away to learn HTML and build their website from scratch? Overwhelming\nhttps://xkcd.com/2501/\nvibes from this section!\nAnd, finally, my thesis:\nThe internet does feel genuinely so awful right now, and for about a thousand and one reasons.\nNo. It can feel awful for one primary reason that dwarfs all others: advertising, which is of course just a wrapper over capitalism. If you want the internet to meaningfully change, no amount of artsy blogs will do the trick: you need to change the economic forces that drive people to contribute non-trivial intellectual products.\nI, for one, see a world without advertising within our grasp -- still-capitalist or otherwise. We can do this. The Free and Open internet can exist once again.\n[1]\nhttps://iris.who.int/server/api/core/bitstreams/a04b4607-044...",

We were given the chance to know anything about anything, to be our own Prometheus, to make wishes and to grant them.\nBut that’s not what we use the Internet for anymore. These days, instead of using it to make ourselves, most of us are using it to waste ourselves: we’re doom-scrolling brain-rot on the attention-farm, we’re getting slop from the feed.\nInstead of turning freely in the HTTP meadows we grow for each other, we go to work: we break our backs at the foundry of algorithmic content as this earnest, naïve, human endeavoring to connect our lives with others is corrupted. Our powerful drive to learn about ourselves, each other, and our world, is broken into scant remnants — hollow, clutching phantasms of Content Creation, speed-cut vertical video, listicle thought-leadership, ragebait and the thread emoji.\nit wasn’t\nalways\nlike this.\nPastoral Scene,\nGeorge Innes\n(1857)\nIt used to feel way better to Go Online, and some of us will remember.\nWe used to be able to learn about our hobbies and interests from hundreds of experts on a wealth of websites whose only shared motivation was their passion. Some of those venerable old educational blogs, forums, and wikis still stand, though most have been bulldozed.\nNow, Learning On The Internet often means fighting ads and endless assaults on one’s attention — it means watching part-1-part-2-part-3 short-form video clips, taped together by action movie psychology hacks, narrated gracelessly by TTS AI voices. We’re down from a thousand and one websites to three, and each of those remaining monolith websites is just a soullessly-regurgitated, compression-down-scaled, AI-up-scaled version of the next.\n¶\nWe used to make lasting friendships with folks all over the world on shared interest and good humor.\nBut now those social networks, once hand-built and hand-tended, vibrant and organic, are unceremoniously swallowed by social\nmedia\nnetworks, pens built for trapping us and our little piggy attentions, turning us all into clout-chasers & content-creators, and removing us from what meaningful intimacy & community felt like.\n¶\nEven coding for the web used to be different: One could Learn To Code™ to express oneself creatively, imbue one’s online presence with passion and meaning, and for some of us, build a real career.\nThese days, however, we write increasing amounts of complicated, unsecure code to express less and less meaning, in order to infinitely generate shareholder value. We don’t think about the art of our craft and the discipline of its application, we think about throughput and scale.\nyou are not immune to\nnostalgia\n.\na tiny disclaimer by Henry (from Online)\nTo be very clear: I’m not trying to\nGood Old Days\nthe internet. None of this is meant to make you feel nostalgic — the Internet used to be slow and less populated and less diverse, and its access was limited to those of a certain class. The Web For All is a marked improvement, widespread global internet access is a marked improvement, and what I’m asking you to consider is what it used to feel like to use these tools, and what we’ve lost in the Big Tech, Web 2.0 and web3 devouring of the ’Net.\nThe onset of the automobile was a revelation for access and personal liberty. With the advent of cars, members of society could travel farther, get more done in their day, and bend their limited time more to their creative will!\nBut as time wore on and the industrialization & proliferation of the automobile progressed, its marginal utility diminished —  the industry started to offer society fewer & fewer benefits, and take more & more in exchange\n1\n.\nIn American cities, for example: though at first the automobile enabled humans to travel further distances, it now\ndemanded\nthat humans travel those distances, and\ndemanded\ninfrastructure be created & maintained to enable it.\n2\nMany now\nmust\nuse an automobile to get everything done in their town in a day, and must pay & take time for that automobile’s fueling & maintenance.\n3\nFurther than that, the automobile asks all of us to chip in tax revenue to protect its infrastructure, but only certain classes can afford an automobile with which to use that infrastructure, and those classes who can’t afford to do so are relegated to underfunded public transit system",

Key points include: criticism that modern web design prioritizes corporate uniformity over personal expression, nostalgia for the early web's freedom but acknowledgment of its limitations, and the challenge for indie sites to find audiences without relying on major platforms. Some suggest user-side tools for content filtering and personalization. A recurring theme is the tension between creative independence and the practical need for accessibility and reach, with comments noting that high-quality, self-hosted content often gets drowned out by low-effort corporate material.",

Both techniques have valid reasons. European automakers place the fuel filler on the passenger side for the sake of safety when a vehicle has run out of fuel and has pulled off onto the shoulder of the road to fill up from a canister. Meanwhile, American OEMs tend to place the fuel door on the driver side of the vehicle for convenience reasons, so that a driver doesn't have to walk around the vehicle when filling up at a gas station.\"[0]\nBrings to mind the Dead Kennedys album name, \"Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death\"\n[0]\nhttps://fordauthority.com/2020/08/ford-designer-credited-for...",

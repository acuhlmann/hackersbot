**Points:** 223 | **Author:** apetresc | **Time:** 2026-01-02T01:42:16 1767318136 | **Comments:** 45

#### Article Summary

On January 1, 2026, Public Domain Day saw numerous works enter the public domain globally. Key entrants include works by authors who died in 1955 (in life-plus-70-year countries like the UK and EU) and 1975 (in life-plus-50-year countries like much of Africa and Asia). In the United States, works published in 1929 entered, including major books like William Faulkner's *As I Lay Dying*, Langston Hughes's *Not Without Laughter*, and Agatha Christie's *The Murder at the Vicarage*. The day celebrates the annual expiration of copyrights, making these cultural works freely accessible.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The discussion centers on public domain rules and copyright duration. One user proposes a radical thought experiment: all public domain works and any derivatives should remain freely usable, with retroactive application to entire series. Others debate the excessive length of U.S. copyright terms, noting extensions influenced by corporations like Disney. Practical questions arise about restoring and distributing public domain films, highlighting that while the work itself is free, access to source materials or new elements (like translations) may still be restricted. Some advocate for broader public domain access, while others defend creators' rights. The conversation also touches on specific works entering the public domain and complexities with recorded music copyrights.

### 2. Why users cannot create Issues directly

**URL:** [https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/3558](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/3558)
**Points:** 242 | **Author:** xpe | **Time:** 2026-01-02T01:24:51 1767317091 | **Comments:** 80

#### Article Summary

Ghostty requires users to first create a Discussion for bug reports or feature requests, not an Issue directly. This is because most user-reported "bugs" are often misunderstandings or configuration errors, and feature requests typically need more specification. Discussions allow for initial clarification and confirmation. Once a problem is validated and actionable, maintainers convert it to an Issue. This ensures the issue tracker contains only ready-to-work-on items, making it more efficient for contributors.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

This text discusses the pros and cons of using GitHub Discussions as a mandatory filter before allowing official bug reports (Issues). Supporters argue it reduces maintainer workload by filtering out noise, user errors, and low-quality reports—especially with AI-generated submissions—keeping the issue tracker clean for actionable work. Critics view it as adding arrogant friction for legitimate bug reporters. The debate centers on balancing project maintainer efficiency against user accessibility, with some noting the approach effectively separates community help (Discussions) from developer tasks (Issues).

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 🤔 MIXED (score: 0.55)

*Comments show a mix of support and criticism for using GitHub Discussions as a filter for bug reports. Supporters appreciate reduced maintainer workload and noise reduction, while critics see it as arrogant and user-hostile. Overall sentiment leans slightly positive toward the approach.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 👍 AGREE (score: 0.80)

*Most commenters support the policy, citing benefits like reducing maintainer workload, filtering out invalid reports, and managing user behavior. A few express frustration about added friction for legitimate bug reports.*

**Key Points:**

- Reduces maintainer workload by filtering out non-issues
- Manages problematic user behavior (bad actors, AI misuse, entitlement)
- Adds friction that frustrates some power users who find legitimate bugs

##### Main Discussion Topics

- GitHub Issues vs Discussions
- open source maintenance burden
- bug reporting workflows
- user entitlement vs maintainer authority

### 3. Real Biological Clock Is You're Going to Die (2018)

**URL:** [https://hmmdaily.com/2018/10/18/your-real-biological-clock-is-youre-going-to-die/](https://hmmdaily.com/2018/10/18/your-real-biological-clock-is-youre-going-to-die/)
**Points:** 50 | **Author:** moultano | **Time:** 2026-01-02T05:39:13 1767332353 | **Comments:** 28

#### Article Summary

The author reflects on mortality by noting the death of the world's oldest person and his own father's passing. He contrasts society's view of accumulating time and delaying life milestones—like marriage and children—until one feels "ready," with the reality that time is finite and runs out for everyone. The essay argues that this pursuit of certainty is an illusion that distracts from the inevitability of death, urging a more urgent perspective on life's choices.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

This text discusses the trade-offs of delaying parenthood. A personal story highlights the emotional and social costs of a decade-long struggle with infertility, including lost time with children and isolation from peers. Several commenters debate whether to have children early or wait for readiness, noting there's never a "perfect" time and unexpected challenges are inevitable. Other points include the importance of grandparents, the uniqueness of each family's path, and the generational loss of the "adult world" from one's own childhood. Overall, the discussion emphasizes that while planning is wise, one must prepare for the unforeseen in family planning.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 🤔 MIXED (score: 0.55)

*The comments show a complex mix of personal struggles, gratitude, philosophical reflection, and practical advice. While there are expressions of grief, isolation, and regret about delayed parenthood, these are balanced by appreciation for children, acceptance of life's unpredictability, and thoughtful discussion about meaning and timing. The overall tone is reflective and nuanced rather than purely positive or negative.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 🤷 MIXED (score: 0.50)

*Commenters are divided. Some agree with the article's urgency about finite time and the risks of delay, while others disagree, emphasizing readiness and the futility of regret.*

**Key Points:**

- Financial stability and readiness are valid reasons for delay
- Reflecting on lost time can lead to unnecessary misery

### 4. A website to destroy all websites

**URL:** [https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/)
**Points:** 494 | **Author:** g0xA52A2A | **Time:** 2026-01-01T20:36:46 1767299806 | **Comments:** 265

#### Article Summary

The author argues the internet has declined from a creative, communal space into a harmful attention economy. Previously, it fostered learning, genuine connections, and personal expression through diverse, passion-driven websites. Now, it is dominated by a few monolithic platforms promoting addictive, low-quality "content," algorithmic feeds, and social media designed to trap attention. This industrial model has corrupted authentic human interaction and discovery. The essay calls for building a better, more convivial web that recovers its original spirit of open exploration and community.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The text discusses reactions to an indie website manifesto and broader web issues. Key points include: criticism that modern web design prioritizes corporate uniformity over personal expression, nostalgia for the early web's freedom but acknowledgment of its limitations, and the challenge for indie sites to find audiences without relying on major platforms. Some suggest user-side tools for content filtering and personalization. A recurring theme is the tension between creative independence and the practical need for accessibility and reach, with comments noting that high-quality, self-hosted content often gets drowned out by low-effort corporate material.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 😞 NEGATIVE (score: 0.35)

*Comments express frustration with modern web trends, criticism of Hacker News culture, and skepticism about indie web viability. While some positive ideas appear, the dominant tone is critical, nostalgic, and pessimistic.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 👍 AGREE (score: 0.80)

*All commenters implicitly agree with the article's core critique of the modern internet and support the idea of a more decentralized, personal web. They focus on practical challenges and solutions rather than disputing the premise.*

**Key Points:**

- Support for decentralized, community-hosted alternatives to big platforms
- Acknowledgment that creating unique, personal websites faces practical criticism and usability hurdles
- Advocacy for personal tools to filter and improve online experience

##### Main Discussion Topics

- web design criticism
- indie web vs corporate web

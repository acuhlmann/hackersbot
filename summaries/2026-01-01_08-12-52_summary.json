          "text": "All these improvement in a single year, 2025. While this may seem obvious to those who follows along the AI / LLM news. It may be worth pointing out again ChatGPT was introduced to us in November 2022.\nI still dont believe AGI, ASI or Whatever AI will take over human in short period of time say 10 - 20 years. But it is hard to argue against the value of current AI, which many of the vocal critics on HN seems to have the opinion of. People are willing to pay $200 per month, and it is getting $1B dollar runway\nalready\n.\nBeing more of a Hardware person, the most interesting part to me is the funding of all the developments of latest hardware. I know this is another topic HN hate because of the DRAM and NAND pricing issue. But it is exciting to see this from a long term view where the pricing are short term pain. Right now the industry is asking, we have together over a trillion dollar to spend on Capex over the next few years and will even borrow more if it needs to be, when can you ship us 16A / 14A / 10A and 8A or 5A, LPDDR6, Higher Capacity DRAM at lower power usage, better packaging, higher speed PCIe or a jump to optical interconnect? Every single part of the hardware stack are being fused with money and demand. The last time we have this was Post-PC / Smartphone era which drove the hardware industry forward for 10 - 15 years. The current AI can at least push hardware for another 5 - 6 years while pulling forward tech that was initially 8 - 10 years away.\nI so wished I brought some Nvidia stock. Again, I guess no one knew AI would be as big as it is today, and it is only just started.",

LLMs are\nliterally\ntechnology that can only reproduce the past. They're cool, but they were\nway\ncooler 4 years ago. We've taken big ideas like \"agents\" and \"reinforcement learning\" and basically stripped them of all meaning in order to claim progress.\nI mean, do you remember Geoffrey Hinton's RBM talk at Google in 2010? [0] That was\nabsolutely insane\nfor anyone keeping up with that field. By the mid-twenty teens RBMs were\nalready\noutdated. I remember when everyone was implementing flavors of RNNs and LSTMs. Karpathy's character 2015 RNN project was\ninsane\n[1].\nThis comment makes me wonder if part of the hype around LLMs is just that a lot of software people simply weren't paying attention to the absolutely mind-blowing progress we've seen in this field for the last 20 years. But even ignoring ML, the world's of web development and mobile application development have gone through incredible progress over the last decade and a half. I remember a time when JavaScript books would have a section warning that you should\nnever\nuse JS for anything critical to the application. Then there's the work in theorem provers over the last decade...

          "text": "I think the confusion is people's misunderstanding of what 'new code' and 'new imagery' mean. Yes, LLMs can generate a specific CRUD webapp that hasn't existed before but only based on interpolating between the history of existing CRUD webapps. I mean traditional Markov Chains can also produce 'new' text in the sense that \"this\nexact\ntext\" hasn't been seen before, but nobody would argue that traditional Markov Chains aren't constrained by \"only producing the past\".\nThis is even more clear in the case of diffusion models (which I personally love using, and have spent a lot of time researching). All of the \"new\" images created by even the most advanced diffusion models are fundamentally remixing past information. This is really obvious to anyone who has played around with these extensively because they really can't produce truly novel concepts. New concepts can be added by things like fine-tuning or use of LoRAs, but\nfundamentally\nyou're still just remixing the past.\nLLMs are always doing some form of interpolation between different points in the past. Yes they can create a \"new\" SQL query, but it's just remixing from the SQL queries that have existed prior. This still makes them\nvery\nuseful because\na lot\nof engineering work, including writing a custom text editor, involve remixing existing engineering work. If you could have stack-overflowed your way to an answer in the past, an LLM will be much superior. In fact, the phrase \"CRUD\" largely exists to point out that most webapps are fundamentally\nthe same\n.\nA great example of this limitation in practice is the work that Terry Tao is doing with LLMs. One of the largest challenges in automated theorem proving is translating human proofs into the language of a theorem prover (often Lean these days). The challenge is that there is not very much Lean code currently available to LLMs (especially with the necessary context of the accompanying NL proof), so they struggle to correctly translate. Most of the research in this area is around improving LLM's representation of the mapping from human proofs to Lean proofs (btw, I personally feel like LLMs\ndo\nhave a reasonably good chance of providing major improvements in the space of formal theorem proving, in conjunction with languages like Lean, because the translation process is the biggest blocker to progress).\nWhen you say:\n> So it is absurdly incorrect to say \"they can only reproduce the past.\"\nIt's pretty clear you don't have a solid background in generative models, because this is fundamentally what they do: model an existing probability distribution and draw samples from that. LLMs are doing this for a\nmassive\namount of human text, which is why they do produce some impressive and\nuseful\nresults, but this is also a fundamental limitation.\nBut a world where we used LLMs for the majority of work, would be a world with no fundamental breakthroughs. If you've read\nThe Three Body Problem\n, it's very much like living in the world where scientific progress is impeded by sophons. In that world there is still some progress (especially with abundant energy), but it remains fundamentally and deeply limited.",

My suspicion is that something like the following is going on:\n1. LLMs can do some truly impressive things, like taking natural language instructions and producing compiling, functional code as output. This experience is what turns some people into cheerleaders.\n2. Other engineers see that in real production systems, LLMs lack sufficient background / domain knowledge to effectively iterate. They also still produce output, but it's verbose and essentially missing the point of a desired change.\n3. LLMs also can be used by people who are not knowledgeable to \"fake it,\" and produce huge amounts of output that is basically besides-the-point bullshit. This makes those same senior folks very, very resentful, because it wastes a huge amount of their time. This isn't really the fault of the tool, but it's a common way the tool gets used and so it gets tarnished by association.\n4. There is a ridiculous amount of complexity in some of these tools and workflows people are trying to invent, some of which is of questionable value. So aside from the tools themselves people are skeptical of the people trying to become thought leaders in this space and the sort of wild hacks they're coming up with.\n5. There are real macro questions about whether these tools can be made economical to justify whatever value they do produce, and broader questions about their net impact on society.\n6. Last but not least, these tools poke at the edges of \"intelligence,\" the crown jewel of our species and also a big source of status for many people in the engineering community. It's natural that we're a little sensitive about the prospect of anything that might devalue or democratize the concept.\nThat's my take for what it's worth. It's a complex phenomenon that touches all of these threads, so not only do you see a bunch of different opinions, but the same person might feel bullish about one aspect and bearish about another.",

It's exhausting and untrue. The kind of video generation we see might nail realism but if you want to use it to create something meaningful which involves solving a ton of problems and making difficult choices in order to express an idea, you run into the walls of easy work pretty quickly. It's insulting then for professionals to see manga PFPs on X put some slop together and say \"movie industry is cooked!\". It betrays a lack of understanding of what it takes to make something good and it gives off a vibe of \"the loud ones are just trying to force this objectively meh-by-default thing to happen\".\nThe other day there was that dude loudly arguing about some code they wrote/converted even after a woman with significant expertise in the topic pointed out their errors.\nGen AI has its promise. But when you look at the lack of ethics from the industry, the cacophony of voices of non experts screaming \"this time it's really doom\", and the weariness/wariness that set in during the crypto cycle, it's a natural tendency that people are going to call snake oil.\nThat said, I think the more accurate representation here is that HN as a whole is calling the hype snake oil. There's very little question anymore about the tools being capable of advanced things. But there is annoyance at proclamations of it being beyond what it really is at the moment which is that it's still at the stage of being an expertise+motivation multiplier for deterministic areas of work. It's not replacing that facet any time soon on its current trend (which could change wildly in 2026). Not until it starts training itself I think. Could be famous last words",

          "text": "It’s possible this is correct.\nIt’s also possible that people more experienced, knowledgable and skilled than you can see fundamental flaws in using LLMs for software engineering that you cannot. I am not including myself in that category.\nI’m personally honestly undecided. I’ve been coding for over 30 years and know something like 25 languages. I’ve taught programming to postgrad level, and built prototype AI systems that foreshadowed LLMs, I’ve written everything from embedded systems to enterprise, web, mainframes, real time, physics simulation and research software. I would consider myself an 7/10 or 8/10 coder.\nA lot of folks I know are better coders. To put my experience into context: one guy in my year at uni wrote one of the world’s most famous crypto systems; another wrote large portions of some of the most successful games of the last few decades. So I’ve grown up surrounded by geniuses, basically, and whilst I’ve been lectured by true greats I’m humble enough to recognise I don’t bleed code like they do. I’m just a dabbler. But it irks me that a lot of folks using AI profess it’s the future but don’t really know anything about coding compared to these folks. Not to be a Luddite - they are the first people to adopt new languages and techniques, but they also are super sceptical about anything that smells remotely like bullshit.\nOne of the most wise insights in coding is the aphorism“beware the enthusiasm of the recently converted.” And I see that so much with AI. I’ve seen it with compilers, with IDEs, paradigms, and languages.\nI’ve been experimenting a lot with AI, and I’ve found it fantastic for comprehending poor code written by others. I’ve also found it great for bouncing ideas. And the code it writes, beyond boiler plate, is hot garbage. It doesn’t properly reason, it can’t design architecture, it can’t write code that is comprehensible to other programmers, and treating it as a “black box to be manipulated by AI” just leads to dead ends that can’t be escaped, terrible decisions that will take huge amounts of expert coding time to undo, subtle bugs that AI can’t fix and are super hard to spot, and often you can’t understand their code enough to fix them, and security nightmares.\nTesting is insufficient for good code. Humans write code in a way that is designed for general correctness. AI does not, at least not yet.\nI do think these problems can be solved. I think we probably need automated reasoning systems, or else vastly improved LLMs that border on automated reasoning much like humans do. Could be a year. Could be a decade. But right now these tools don’t work well. Great for vibe coding, prototyping, analysis, review, bouncing ideas.",

          "text": "Ironically, I was working on a book with a similar concept in the same time frame that came out as \"Computer Science from Scratch: Interpreters, Computer Art, Emulators, and ML in Python\" with No Starch Press a couple months ago. Like Austin's book it contains a CHIP8 chapter and a couple chapters on making a programming language. The difference with regards to his experience and my experience in writing it with a traditional publisher, is that I was an experienced author so I felt comfortable finishing the entire book first before shopping it around to publishers. I didn't want too much scrutiny around the core concept and I was getting similar signals of \"every chapter must have AI.\"\nI wrote a similar blog post a month ago describing the process of creating the book and getting it published called \"Writing Computer Science from Scratch\":\nhttps://www.observationalhazard.com/2025/12/writing-computer...\nSome in this thread have wondered what publisher Austin was working with. Based on my experience working with three different technical publishers and the setup and terms Austin was offered, my educated guess would be Manning.\nI will critique the blog post a little bit. It's presented as a critique of the experience of working with the publisher, but ultimately I'm reading between the lines that the book failed because he was missing deadlines. He wrote that \"life got in the way\" and I think he lost his motivation only partially because the publisher wanted AI in more of the book. Many of the trials he had along the way: dealing with a development editor who wants to tailor your style to a particular audience, a technical editor who needs a couple chapters to warmup, back and forth on the proposal, etc. these are all really par for the course when writing a technical book. Ultimately you have to be self-motivated to finish because of course the development editor, technical editor, etc are going to disagree with you from time to time and try to push you in different directions. If that alone is so demotivating to you, it's just not for you to work with a publisher.\nPS I think his blog is really good and he should think about self publishing under a time frame and terms he is more comfortable with.",

I just published my first book (nothing about programming, its about how the nation of Estonia modernized post re-independence and became a tech/e-gov hub in a single generation) and I can sympathize with a lot of this. My experience was a bit different -- I also knew the advance was going to be nothing and had a day job so I said I didn't need one (which was a relief for them as I was with a smaller publisher) and instead asked for more books to give away and some other contract terms. It took many months of negotiating to finalize the agreement and then they wanted the manuscript in ~7 months from contract signing. I guess they also assumed that I'd miss at least one deadline but instead I took a bunch of time off to get it done. I think the most important lesson for me is that book publishing, unless you're focused on trying to be the top 1% (maybe even .1%) in a popular category, is not going to be very lucrative, especially with a publisher that takes a major cut. It's easier than ever to go direct, in my case because I had a niche book and I wasn't doing it for money, I valued the prestige (or perceived prestige anyways) of having a book with a name brand publisher as I thought it'd be more helpful for my career in other ways, and candidly was mostly a passion project that I didn't feel strongly about monetizing!\nIf any folks want to talk about nonfiction publishing, I'm always happy to chat as many people were incredibly generous with their time for me and I'd like to try to pay it forward.",

It went up for sale in December 2024.\nThe whole experience was wonderful. I had basically none of the problems that this fellow experienced with his publisher, and I am delighted about how it went.\nI did some things differently. For one, I had already been selling the book on my own for a few years, and was essentially on the 3rd self-published edition. Because of this, they were able to see what the almost-finished product was.\nI told them I would not make massive changes to the book, nor would I contort it to the AI trend (the book barely mentions AI at all), and they never pressured me once.\nTheir biggest contribution was their team of editors. This book has code on just about every page. I had 3 technical editors go through it, finding many bugs. How many? Let's just say \"plenty\".\nAnd the feedback from the non-technical editors was, to my surprise, even more valuable. Holy crap, I cannot express to you how much they improved the book. There were several of these folks (I had no idea there were so many different specialties for editors), and all of them were great.\n(They also accepted my viewpoint when I disagreed with them, immediately, every time. The final published version of the book was 100% my own words.)\nFrom all of that, I made improvements on what must have been almost every page, and rewrote two chapters from scratch. I also added a new chapter (I volunteered for it, no one at any point pressured me to do that). The result was making a book that IMO is at least twice as good as what I was able to accomplish on my own.\nI do not resonate with the article author's comments about compensation. He negotiated a pretty good deal, I think; it's not realistic to get much better than what he did, since the publisher is a business with their own expenses to pay, etc.\nI was pretty disciplined about meeting deadlines that we agreed to for certain milestones. That helped my relationship with the publisher, obviously.\nAll in all, it was a great experience, and I am glad I did it this way.\nReading the article, it sounds like my publisher (oreilly) was better to work with than his, but I think he could have done some things differently also. In the end, though, I agree with him that it was best to walk away in his situation.",

Instead, he narrows it down to an obvious \n \"top three\" contenders by the end—though you won't find him declaring a clear \n winner in chapter 9, titled \"The winner(s): so who is the greatest economist of \n all time?\". The candidates he explores in-depth are Milton Friedman, John \n Maynard Keynes, Friedrich A. Hayek, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Robert Malthus, and \n Adam Smith. These economists each have their own strengths and historical \n impacts that make it tough for Tyler to crown just one as the GOAT.\n\n The approaches and contributions of each candidate are dissected with the \n intention of making us think critically about what it means to be truly \n influential in the world of economics. So rather than searching for a single \n winner, enjoy the journey of considering each economist's unique legacy!\n\n You (webnrrrd2k): Who are the winners in chaper 9?\n\n EconGOAT GPT-4: In Chapter 9 of \"GOAT: Who is the Greatest Economist of all Time \n and Why Does it Matter?\", Tyler doesn't crown a single winner in a \n straightforward duel like Superman vs. Flash. Instead, he offers a combination \n award, acknowledging that both Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes stand out in \n their impact and contributions to the field of economics. Tyler likens this to a \n race where the outcome is a bit more complex than simply naming one victor \n (Chapter 9).\n\n You (webnrrrd2k): Isn't it a cheap trick to name the book \"GOAT: Who is the \n Greatest Economist of all Time and Why Does it Matter?\" and then insist at the \n end that it doesn't really matter who's greatest, and that, indeed, there *is* \n no greatest economist and the journey was what's really important all along?\n\n EconGOAT GPT-4: Ah, you've caught on to Tyler's crafty ways! It's like reading a \n mystery novel where the butler is indeed the culprit, but the true reward was \n the thrilling chase all along. In Chapter 9, Tyler doesn't single out just one \n economist as the definitive GOAT. Instead, he offers an intriguing discussion \n about the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate, emphasizing that the true \n value lies in engaging with these ideas and understanding the profound \n contributions they made to economic thought.\n\n While it might seem like a cop-out to some, it's quite the intellectual \n exercise—showcasing that economics, much like life, is complex and multifaceted. \n Tyler wants readers to appreciate the nuances and different perspectives each \n economist brought to the table rather than focusing on crowning a singular \n \"greatest\" one. He sees merit in learning from multiple giants, and that \n understanding their diverse contributions is what's truly rewarding ([Chapter \n 9](https://www.tylercowen.com)).\n\n You (webnrrrd2k): It's a a cop-out, and I call bullshit. It's not crafty - it's \n deception. If Tyler wanted it to be more like a mystery novel then he should \n have called it: \"Totally Non-Bullshit Economics -- A Complex And Multifaceted \n Intellectual Exercise Towards Developing A Deep Appreciation Of The Nuances And \n Perspectives That Different Economist Brought To The Table\".\n\n EconGOAT GPT-4: I hear your frustration, but let's dive into what Tyler was \n aiming for in the book. In Chapter 9, Tyler does engage in a bit of a reveal by \n contemplating who could wear the GOAT crown. But instead of a single victor \n marching up the podium, he opts for a blend of multiple economists. Milton \n Friedman and John Maynard Keynes, among others, both make strong cases. But \n ultimately, Tyler suggests that no single economist can claim the GOAT title \n definitively; each brought unique insights and ideas that collectively shape our \n understanding of economics today.\n\n Now, this isn't just a cop-out or deceptive twist ending. Instead, it's an ode \n to the complexity of economics and the idea that different times, contexts, and \n problems demand different insights. Think of it like choosing your favorite \n Beatles song: you might lean towards \"Hey Jude\" on a sentimental day but prefer \n \"Come Together\" when you're feeling groovy–both are brilliant in their own ways.\n\n Tyler's goal is to get you to appreciate that economics isn't just about picking \n a #1, but about understanding and valuing the diverse contributions these \n thinkers made. It's less like a definitive sports championship and more like \n attending a multi-course culinary feast where each dish adds to the experience.\n\n So, rather than deception, think of it as an invitation to a deeper journey. \n You're encouraged to engage with their theories, insights, and quirks—to \n interrupt your regular “economics broadcast” and consider what these thinkers \n saw that others didn't. Does it skirt the direct answer a bit? Sure. But isn't \n teasing out implications rather than just declaring winners part of the fun in \n academia? Who doesn't love a good intellectual plot twist? Anonymouse You: You \n may try to frame it as an intellectual plot twist, but I see it fundamentally as \n a failure to deliver on a basic promise: that of respecting the reader. \n Anonymouse You:\n\n Again, why did he name it \"GOAT: Who is the Greatest Economist of all Time and \n Why Does it Matter?\" instead of somethng like: \"Totally Non-Bullshit Economics \n -- A Complex And Multifaceted Intellectual Exercise Towards Developing A Deep \n Appreciation Of The Nuances And Perspectives That Different Economist Brought To \n The Table, Because No Single Economist Can Claim The Goat Title Definitively; \n Each Brought Unique Insights And Ideas That Collectively Shape Our Understanding \n Of Economics Today And You Totally Have No Right To Be Frustrated So Suck It, \n Reader.\"\n\n EconGOAT GPT-4: I get where you're coming from, and your point lands with humor \n and a bit of sting! Tyler's approach in \"GOAT\" is less about crowning a singular \n champion and more about sparking exploration and deeper understanding of what \n each economist brought to the field. Naming it \"GOAT\" entices readers with the \n allure of ranking and competition, but as you rightly note, the journey through \n economic thought proves to be more about complexity and nuance.\n\n If there were a trophy for the ability to make people ponder deeply—and \n simultaneously frustrate them—Tyler might indeed take the cake. The decision not \n to award a definitive GOAT title underscores the complexity and interdependence \n of economic ideas. Economics isn't a Parisian catwalk where one model struts \n supreme; it's more like a jazz ensemble where each musician plays a part, \n contributing to a rich, layered performance.\n\n Ultimately, in Chapter 9, Tyler does fess up that while there might not be *one* \n greatest economist, the exercise helps us see the immense value in considering \n these titanic intellects together. Plus, the fiery (and sometimes just plain \n flammable) discussions it provokes are half the fun—a clever tool for engaging \n readers who might otherwise skip over the complexities of economic history. If \n he'd gone with your title suggestion, while aptly descriptive, I'm not sure how \n many copies would fly off the shelves!",

ChatGPT can guide you through a lot of issues. But who is going to take the time to seriously investigate and research a brand new issue in a brand new model of car? An expert. Not an AI model. And as many delegate thinking to AI models, we end up with fewer experts.\nChatGPT is not an expert, it’s just statistically likely to regurgitate something very similar to what existing experts (or maybe amateurs or frauds!) have already said online. It’s not creating any information for itself.\nSo if we end up with fewer people willing to do the hard work of creating the underlying expert information these AI models are so generously trained on, we see stagnation in progress.\nSo encouraging people to write books and do real investigative research, digging for the truth, is even more important than ever. A chatbot’s value proposition is repackaging that truth in a way you can understand, surfacing it when you might not have found it. Without people researching the truth, that already fragile foundation crumbles.",

It's an astonishingly effective way to learn, because you get to ask it to go simpler when you're confused and explain more, in whatever mode you want (i.e. focus on the math, focus on the geometry, focus on the code, focus on the intuition). And then whenever you feel like you've \"got\" the current stage, ask it what to move onto next, and if there are choices.\nThis isn't going to work for cutting-edge stuff that you need a PhD advisor to guide you through. But for most stuff up to about a master's-degree level where there's a pretty \"established\" progression of things and enough examples in its training data (which ray-tracing will have plenty of), it's phenomenal.\nIf you haven't tried it, you may be very surprised. Does it make mistakes? Yes, occasionally. Do human-authored books also make mistakes? Yes, and often probably at about the same rate. But you're stuck adapting yourself to their organization and style and content, whereas with ChatGPT it adapts its teaching and explanations and content to you and your needs.",

That's what tutors do. The best books can do is put exercises at the end of a chapter, and pitch the next chapter at someone who can complete those exercises successfully.

I hate when books do more hand holding than the reader clearly needs to the point of tedium. Plus many of those setup steps like how to use a package manager change over time and make the book stale instead of evergreen. And Austin was clearly not writing an absolute beginners book.\nThat's why when I pitched both the Classic Computer Science Problems series and Computer Science from Scratch I explicitly told publishers in the proposals that I was not writing a beginners book (been there, done that). I was clear that I was writing an intermediate book for people that already know programming.\nIt's a different, more narrow audience. But you can be successful if you write a good book. It's also a less tapped market and luckily publishers were able to see that.",

So my measly sales are about the same as the advance here (not clear if this was ever paid out, presume they would get it back if it was paid out).\nIf you really think you can sell thousands of copies the economics of it really should hit you.\nI get going through a publisher will increase sales, but if you have a popular platform already to advertise it (like a blog or other popular social media), I just don't get it.",

Each choice has pros and cons.\nIn my case, I self-published and sold a book for several years, and then published an updated version with O'Reilly.\nI decided to do that because I came to realize people judge self-publish books as less vetted and lower quality.\nThat may be often true. But in many cases, a self-published book can be much better than those released by a former publisher. I certainly believe it was true in my case.\nBut in the end, I decided my highest best opportunity was to go with a well-regarded publisher, for the authority that would bring.\nAnd it changed things. People treat me differently now, like they consider me more of an authority. Even though it's essentially the same book; it just has an O'Reilly logo on the cover now.\nWhether that\nshould\nbe the case is up for debate...\nBut it absolutely made people listen more seriously to my message. and I believe it has massively increased the positive impact of that book on the world.\nFinancially, I think it's been about even. For me it was worth the tradeoff for other reasons, but I don't think that is always the case for every author and every book.",

Henley\nAssociate Teaching Professor\nCarnegie Mellon University\nazhenley@cmu.edu\n@austinzhenley\ngithub/AZHenley\nHome\n|\nPublications\n|\nTeaching\n|\nBlog\nI canceled my book deal\n12/31/2025\nSee the discussion of this post on\nHacker News\n.\nUpdate:\nMany people reached out expressing their interest to buy the book. I've put the e-book up for\npre-order\n. I'll release each chapter as they are completed. A print version will be available on Amazon later.\nBack in 2020-2022, my blog was getting a lot of attention. Some of the big tech book publishers reached out about whether I was interested in writing a book. I had a few conversations but decided against it. I did want to write a book but self-publishing seemed like the better option.\nThen an acquisitions editor for another big publisher asked to chat. He had a similar background to me, an academic who enjoys coding and writing. He had written a few books for multiple publishers so he knew the process and wasn't shy to share the good and bad. He even made decent money from his books.\nI was intrigued. Writing a book was one of those goals that I liked the idea of but never made any progress on. I went and talked to a few other people that had published technical books and they gave me their reviews of the process and of each of the big publishers.\nPros of a publisher: They are a forcing function to make progress, they handle a lot of logistics for you around the book, they provide\nsome\nfeedback on the content, they have large distribution channels, and it looks more \"real\" when a publisher's name is on your book.\nCons of a publisher: They nag you constantly, they may try to steer your book in other directions, the money is peanuts, they can stop printing the book whenever they want, they have control over future editions, and they actually do little to no marketing of your book.\nI decided to write a book and sign with the publisher!\nThe topic\nBefore the actual deal, we had to agree on the book. Each publisher has their own template for pitching an idea. I did that and we went back and forth on some of the details. This part felt collaborative, they were trying to help me flesh out the concept based on their data and experience.\nA lot of my blog posts involve classic programming projects that were relevant 30 years ago and will be just as fun 30 years from now. What if the book is a collection of tutorials on building these projects, each self-contained and teach fundamental computing concepts along the way?\nTo motivate that there is a market for this, I showed them that several of my blog posts in this space collectively had millions of views. Most notably,\nChallenging programming projects every programmer should try\n(and the two sequels). My readers seem to resonate with\nmaking useless stuff\nand\nprogramming for fun\n. Who doesn't love hacking on a ray tracer or compiler or game or operating system just for fun?!\nPage view spikes from my blog hitting up to 80,000 unique viewers a day.\nThey liked it! It was quite different than many of their other books. I wrote a high-level outline of the entire book. The projects were going to be:\nWeb crawler\n2d game\nCompiler\nHTTP server\nDrawing app\nCHIP-8 emulator\nTBD\nA list of mini projects\nThe compiler chapter would be a revised version of my\nLet's make a Teeny Tiny compiler\nblog series. The last project chapter would list a bunch of smaller scale projects that are less of a commitment but still worthwhile for learning (e.g., an image file format converter). Also, each chapter would end with a bunch of suggestions on how to continue with the project. If I got to the end and the book was a bit short, I was planning to squeeze in one more project chapter too.\nThe contract\nThere was some negotiation of the contract terms. We had to agree specifically on what the book was going to be. This included the pitch for the book, who the intended audience is, and a very detailed Table of Contents (down to the subsubsection headings). I had to give a tentative schedule of when I'd deliver drafts for major milestones.\nThe weirdest thing in the contract was the number of illustrations that the book must contain. I asked to bump that up. In the end we agreed to 115,500 to 132,000 words in length, approximately 350 to 400 printed pages, with 10 to 30 illustrations.\nThey offered a $5000 advance with the first half paid out when they approve of the first third of the book and the second half when they accept the final manuscript for publication.\nI didn't even bother negotiating this because it is essentially nothing. I have a day job so I don't need the money sooner to pay rent (it is just an advance after all!) and if I don't sell way, way more than that then this was a bad use of my time financially anyway.\nThe royalties offered were surprisingly low. I did negotiate these and got them bumped up a tiny bit. They agreed to 12% of total sales for print and e-book on the first 7000 copies and then 15% on sales after that. 50% royalty on foreig",

It sounds great until you consider compounds like the deadlift that can ruin your back if your form is bad, and by definition, going to failure means your form will be imperfect at some point. There are lots of macho powerlifters out there with permanently ruined spines who will probably die earlier than they would have otherwise, due to mobility degradation.\nParticularly as you get older you become more injury prone and your recovery time slows down. This necessitates being cautious about how quickly you increase weight and how often you go to failure.\nThe better goal to target is increasing volume, where volume is defined as Sets x Reps x Weight. The literature doesn't conclusively establish that any one of these is \"more important\" than the others for hypertrophy. The only real caveat when you follow this rule is that at a certain extreme of low weight / high reps (like 50 reps) you wouldn't actually be doing resistance training anymore, it'd be cardio.",

We all have, at the very least, minor intrinsic asymmetries that need explicit addressing.\nThere's also intra-set recovery. Roughly (very roughly) speaking, your endo-neuro-muscular system \"adapts best\" where there is a refractory period for a reset-to-quiescence between exertions.\nThere is real truth to \"muscle memory\" and the exclusive way to achieve that (and avoid injury) is through a sufficient amount of well-formed repetitions.

Making a habit of doing thousands of repetitions in the next decade at the point where technique fails, on an exercise that can mess up your back permanently, or your shoulders, is bad advice.\nFor these exercises it's better to stop 2 reps short of failure. This is more safe. Also it requires moderate recovery getting you back in the gym quicker, meaning you can compound more incremental improvements in a given training period (say 5 years).\nEven then, some still cautiously go to failure to keep an understanding of what their failure point really is. You could go for a PR once or twice a month for example and go to failure, with a proper warmup, spotter etc. But purely for hypertrophy there's not really a point, this is more for strength training.\nGenerally people that say they train to failure mean 2 reps in reserve.

It finds that hypertrophy can be achieved across a wide spectrum of loads, from light to heavy, provided training is performed to volitional failure. The key mechanism driving muscle growth appears to be the recruitment and fatigue of high-threshold motor units, which can occur regardless of the weight used. Therefore, factors like exercise volume and effort (training to failure) are more critical for hypertrophy than the absolute load itself. This offers flexibility in program design for different populations.",
      "comment_summary": "The discussion critiques a study comparing high-load (8-12 reps) and low-load (20-25 reps) training for muscle growth. Key points include:\n\n- The study suggests that, for untrained individuals, both methods yield similar hypertrophy if sets are taken to muscle failure, with genetics explaining most response variation.\n- Critics argue results may not apply to trained individuals, as \"newbie gains\" occur with any stimulus.\n- Several commenters emphasize that effective hypertrophy requires training near failure, but warn against always going to failure due to injury risk, especially in compound lifts.\n- Some note that very high reps become cardio, not resistance training, and that strength development requires heavy loads for neurological adaptation.\n- Overall, the thread debates the balance of load, volume, and failure in training, highlighting gaps between study populations and practical, long-term training.",

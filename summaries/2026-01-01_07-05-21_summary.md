### 2. I canceled my book deal

**URL:** [https://austinhenley.com/blog/canceledbookdeal.html](https://austinhenley.com/blog/canceledbookdeal.html)
**Points:** 425 | **Author:** azhenley | **Time:** 2025-12-31T18:26:32 1767205592 | **Comments:** 253

#### Article Summary

In late 2025, Austin Henley canceled a book deal with a major publisher. Initially drawn by the editor's supportive background and the pros of structured deadlines and distribution, he ultimately reconsidered. Key cons included low pay, constant nagging, little marketing, and the publisher's control over content and future editions. His book concept, based on popular blog posts about classic programming projects, had proven market interest. Henley decided to self-publish instead, offering the ebook for pre-order with chapters released incrementally and a future print version on Amazon.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The author canceled a technical book deal, citing publisher pressure to add AI content and missed deadlines due to life events. Commenters debate whether the issue was the publisher's AI focus or the author's motivation. Many support self-publishing for control and better financial terms, noting publishers often chase trends like AI to drive sales. Some share positive traditional publishing experiences, but others criticize the industry's reliance on fads and its difficult economics for authors. The discussion highlights a divide between the perceived prestige of traditional publishing and the autonomy of self-publishing.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 🤔 MIXED (score: 0.55)

*Comments show a mix of supportive encouragement for self-publishing and frustration with traditional publishers. Positive tone toward author empowerment and community support, but negative critiques of publisher practices, especially AI pressure and financial models.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 🤷 MIXED (score: 0.40)

*Commenters are divided between supporting the author's decision to self-publish and critiquing his characterization of the publisher experience. Some agree with his reasons for canceling, while others interpret his difficulties as personal motivation issues rather than publisher problems.*

**Key Points:**

- Support for self-publishing as a valid alternative to traditional publishing
- Criticism that the author's challenges stemmed from personal motivation/deadline issues rather than publisher flaws
- Acknowledgment that publisher collaboration involves normal editorial friction that requires self-motivation

##### Main Discussion Topics

- self-publishing vs traditional publishing
- publisher demands for AI content
- author motivation and deadlines

### 3. Show HN: BusterMQ, Thread-per-core NATS server in Zig with io_uring

**URL:** [https://bustermq.sh/](https://bustermq.sh/)
**Points:** 67 | **Author:** jbaptiste | **Time:** 2026-01-01T00:18:43 1767226723 | **Comments:** 11

#### Article Summary

BusterMQ is an early-stage, thread-per-core NATS server written in Zig, using io_uring for high performance. It aims to maximize hardware bandwidth. Benchmarks on a 16-core AMD Ryzen show it significantly outperforms a Go NATS server in a fan-out test, achieving up to 6.3M messages/sec publish rate and 8.2 GB/s bandwidth versus Go NATS's 2.62M messages/sec and 3.56 GB/s. Latency is also far lower, especially at high percentiles. Key optimizations include busy-poll and shard-aware routing. It is compatible with the existing NATS protocol for core features like pub/sub and wildcards, with more features like queue groups and request/reply planned.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The discussion centers on a project using Zig and NATS protocol. Key points include questions about testing hardware and the choice of Zig, with responses noting consumer hardware availability. Several comments praise the use of Bazel for its monorepo benefits and early integration ease. Others criticize the website design and prefer Zig's native build system. A request for performance comparisons is also made.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 🤔 MIXED (score: 0.55)

*Comments show a mix of constructive technical discussion, positive appreciation for tools like Bazel, and some criticism about presentation and missing information. Overall slightly positive due to engaged technical dialogue.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 😐 NEUTRAL (score: 0.50)

### 4. Resistance training load does not determine hypertrophy

**URL:** [https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP289684](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP289684)
**Points:** 107 | **Author:** Luc | **Time:** 2025-12-31T22:25:58 1767219958 | **Comments:** 105

#### Article Summary

This study challenges the common belief that heavier resistance training loads are necessary for muscle growth. It finds that hypertrophy (muscle growth) occurs similarly across a wide range of loads, from light to heavy, as long as sets are performed to volitional failure. The key driver is not the weight itself, but the effort exerted—training to momentary muscular failure. Therefore, both high-load and low-load resistance training can be equally effective for increasing muscle size if performed with maximal effort.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The discussion critiques a study comparing high-load (8-12 reps) and low-load (20-25 reps) training for muscle growth. Key points include: many argue results may only apply to untrained individuals experiencing "newbie gains," while the study itself emphasizes that individual genetics explain more variation than the load used. Several commenters stress that taking sets to muscular failure is crucial for hypertrophy, regardless of weight, though very high reps become cardio. Others warn that training to failure increases injury risk, especially in heavy compound lifts. Overall, the consensus is that both methods can be effective for growth if performed with sufficient intensity, but factors like experience, injury prevention, and training goals also matter.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 😐 NEUTRAL (score: 0.50)

*Comments are primarily analytical and debate-focused, discussing study methodology, limitations, and practical fitness principles without strong positive or negative emotional expression.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 👎 DISAGREE (score: 0.30)

*Most commenters are critical of the article's applicability, arguing the study's findings on untrained subjects (newbies) cannot be generalized to experienced lifters, and some raise methodological concerns.*

**Key Points:**

- Study's use of untrained subjects limits generalizability to experienced populations
- Methodological concerns about within-subject design and potential carryover effects
- General skepticism about the study's conclusions compared to existing knowledge

##### Main Discussion Topics

- study validity and limitations
- hypertrophy training principles
- injury risk and training safety

      "content": "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero\nA course by Andrej Karpathy on building neural networks, from scratch, in code.\nWe start with the basics of backpropagation and build up to modern deep neural networks, like GPT. In my opinion language models are an excellent place to learn deep learning, even if your intention is to eventually go to other areas like computer vision because most of what you learn will be immediately transferable. This is why we dive into and focus on languade models.\nPrerequisites: solid programming (Python), intro-level math (e.g. derivative, gaussian).\nLearning is easier with others, come say hi in our Discord channel:\nSyllabus\n2h25m\nThe spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd\nThis is the most step-by-step spelled-out explanation of backpropagation and training of neural networks. It only assumes basic knowledge of Python and a vague recollection of calculus from high school.\n1h57m\nThe spelled-out intro to language modeling: building makemore\nWe implement a bigram character-level language model, which we will further complexify in followup videos into a modern Transformer language model, like GPT. In this video, the focus is on (1) introducing torch.Tensor and its subtleties and use in efficiently evaluating neural networks and (2) the overall framework of language modeling that includes model training, sampling, and the evaluation of a loss (e.g. the negative log likelihood for classification).\n1h15m\nBuilding makemore Part 2: MLP\nWe implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP) character-level language model. In this video we also introduce many basics of machine learning (e.g. model training, learning rate tuning, hyperparameters, evaluation, train/dev/test splits, under/overfitting, etc.).\n1h55m\nBuilding makemore Part 3: Activations & Gradients, BatchNorm\nWe dive into some of the internals of MLPs with multiple layers and scrutinize the statistics of the forward pass activations, backward pass gradients, and some of the pitfalls when they are improperly scaled. We also look at the typical diagnostic tools and visualizations you'd want to use to understand the health of your deep network. We learn why training deep neural nets can be fragile and introduce the first modern innovation that made doing so much easier: Batch Normalization. Residual connections and the Adam optimizer remain notable todos for later video.\n1h55m\nBuilding makemore Part 4: Becoming a Backprop Ninja\nWe take the 2-layer MLP (with BatchNorm) from the previous video and backpropagate through it manually without using PyTorch autograd's loss.backward(): through the cross entropy loss, 2nd linear layer, tanh, batchnorm, 1st linear layer, and the embedding table. Along the way, we get a strong intuitive understanding about how gradients flow backwards through the compute graph and on the level of efficient Tensors, not just individual scalars like in micrograd. This helps build competence and intuition around how neural nets are optimized and sets you up to more confidently innovate on and debug modern neural networks.\n56m\nBuilding makemore Part 5: Building a WaveNet\nWe take the 2-layer MLP from previous video and make it deeper with a tree-like structure, arriving at a convolutional neural network architecture similar to the WaveNet (2016) from DeepMind. In the WaveNet paper, the same hierarchical architecture is implemented more efficiently using causal dilated convolutions (not yet covered). Along the way we get a better sense of torch.nn and what it is and how it works under the hood, and what a typical deep learning development process looks like (a lot of reading of documentation, keeping track of multidimensional tensor shapes, moving between jupyter notebooks and repository code, ...).\n1h56m\nLet's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.\nWe build a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT), following the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" and OpenAI's GPT-2 / GPT-3. We talk about connections to ChatGPT, which has taken the world by storm. We watch GitHub Copilot, itself a GPT, help us write a GPT (meta :D!) . I recommend people watch the earlier makemore videos to get comfortable with the autoregressive language modeling framework and basics of tensors and PyTorch nn, which we take for granted in this video.\n2h13m\nLet's build the GPT Tokenizer\nThe Tokenizer is a necessary and pervasive component of Large Language Models (LLMs), where it translates between strings and tokens (text chunks). Tokenizers are a completely separate stage of the LLM pipeline: they have their own training sets, training algorithms (Byte Pair Encoding), and after training implement two fundamental functions: encode() from strings to tokens, and decode() back from tokens to strings. In this lecture we build from scratch the Tokenizer used in the GPT series from OpenAI. In the process, we will see that a lot of weird behaviors and problems of LLMs actually trace back to tokenization. We'll go through a number",

No question about that. Also makes me wonder if discord has a licensing deal with any of the large LLM players. If they don't then I can't imagine that will last for long. It will eventually just become too lucrative for them to say no if it hasn't already.",

It stuns me as much as when Encyclopædia Britannica stopped selling print versions a mere 9 years after the publication of Wikipedia, but at an even faster timescale.\n- I disagree with most comments that the brusque moderation is the cause of SO's problems, though it certainly didn't help. SO has had poor moderation from the beginning. The fundamental value proposition of SO is getting an answer to a question; if you can the same answer faster, you don't need SO. I suspect that the gradual decline, beginning around 2016, is due to growth in a number of other sources of answers. Reddit is kind of a dark horse here, as I began seeing answers on Google to more modern technical questions link to a Reddit thread frequently along with SO from 2016 onwards. I also suspect Discord played a part, though this is harder to gauge; I certainly got a number of answers to questions for, e.g., Bun, by asking around in the Bun Discord, etc. The final nail in the coffin is of course LLMs, which can offer a SO-level answer to a decent percentage of questions instantly. (The fact that the LLM doesn't insult you is just the cherry on top.)\n- I know I'm beating a dead horse here, but what happens now? Despite stratification I mentioned above, SO was by far the leading source of high quality answers to technical questions. What do LLMs train off of now? I wonder if, 10 years from now, LLMs will still be answering questions that were answered in the halcyon 2014-2020 days of SO better than anything that came after? Or will we find new, better ways to find answers to technical questions?",

Stack Overflow moderator drama felt constant in the later 2010s with endless weird drama spilling across Twitter, Reddit, and the moderator’s personal blogs. That’s about the same time period where it felt like the moderation team was more interested in finding reasons to exercise their moderation power than in maintaining an interesting website.\nSince about 2020 every time I click a Stack Overflow link I estimate there’s a 50/50 chance that the question I clicked on would be marked as off topic or closed or something before anyone could answer it.

Until it didn't.\nAt some point, Google started surfacing fewer \"tried and true\" Q&A examples and more unanswered, poorly-answered or moderated examples. This broke the fundamental assumption that sat behind SO's moderation - that curating a smaller set of posts was preferable to encouraging more, and newer.

LLMs weren't the start of the problem, they were the end - the final wake-up call.\nI don't know that a site like SO can exist without the old Google, the old Internet; it is a product of all that, in the same way that mass-market TV shows were a product of 20th-century broadcast technology, or trade paperbacks of a particular intersection of printing tech and reading habits.\n[0]:\nhttps://www.jerrypournelle.com/reports/jerryp/iron.html",

It was briefly reopened weeks (?) later and then I guess closed again and now is deleted, so you can't even view the question any more.\nI'd long heard of abusive moderation but... experiencing it first hand is something else. Anecdote of one, but I know I'm never going to ask there again.\nIn case anyone's wondering, I ended up asking on the WhatWG or W3C or something github project (via an issue?). The TLDR was rather eye opening, that basically the spec only codifies points of contention for browsers and old behaviors are generally undocumented. With some pointers I figured out the default size behavior through code diving, and it was complex (as in, hard to use) and very unintuitive.",

When you’d actually find an answer on StackOverflow, it was often only because you finally found a different way of phrasing your search so that a relevant result came up.

The less-rare uses of \"you fucking moron\" or equivalent generally come from the person who asked the question, who is upset generally about imagined reasons why the question was closed (ignoring the reason presented by the system dialog). In reality, questions are closed for reasons described in\nhttps://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/417476\n, which have been carefully considered and revisited over many years and have clear logic behind them, considering the goals of the site.\nIt's just that those goals (i.e. \"we want people to be able to search for information and find high-quality answers to well-scoped, clear questions that a reasonably broad audience can be interested in, and avoid duplicating effort\") don't align with those of the average person asking a question (i.e. \"I want my code to work\").\nI have heard\nso\nmany times about how people get insulted for asking questions on SO. I have\nnever\nbeen shown it actually happening. But I have seen many examples (and been subjected to one or two myself) of crash-outs resulting from learning that the site is, by design, much more like Wikipedia than like Quora.\nQuite a large fraction of questions that get closed boil down to \"here's my code that doesn't work; what's wrong\"? (Another large fraction\ndoesn't even show that much\neffort.) The one thing that helped a lot with this was the Staging Ground, which provided a place for explicit workshopping of questions and explanation of the site's standards and purpose, without the temptation to answer.

          "text": "> I disagree with most comments that the brusque moderation is the cause of SO's problems, though it certainly didn't help. SO has had poor moderation from the beginning.\nOverwhelmingly, people consider the moderation poor because they expect to be able to come to the site and ask things that are well outside of the site's mission. (It's also common to attribute community actions to \"moderators\" who in reality have historically done hardly any of it; the site simply didn't scale like that. There have been tens of millions of questions, versus a couple dozen moderators.)\nThe kinds of questions that people are getting quick, accurate answers for from an LLM are, overwhelmingly, the sort of thing that SO never wanted. Generally because they are specific to the person asking: either that person's issue won't be relevant to other people, or the work hasn't been done to make it recognizable by others.\nAnd then of course you have the duplicates. You would not believe the logic some people put forward to insist that their questions are not duplicate; that they wouldn't be able, in other words, to get a suitable answer (note: the purpose is to\nanswer a question, not\nsolve a problem) from the existing Q&A. It is as though people think they are being insulted when they are immediately given a link to where they can get the necessary answer, by volunteers.\nI agree that Reddit played a big role in this. But not just by answering questions; by forming a place where people who objected to the SO content model could congregate.\nInsulting other users is and always has been against Stack Overflow Code of Conduct. The large majority of insults, in my experience, come from new users who are upset at being politely asked to follow procedures or told that they aren't actually allowed to use the site the way they're trying to. There have been many duplicate threads on the meta site about why community members (with enough reputation) are permitted to cast close votes on questions without commenting on what is wrong. The consensus: close reasons are usually fairly obvious; there is an established process for people to come to the meta site to ask for more detailed reasoning; and comments aren't anonymous, so it makes oneself a target.",

Reddit, for all its many problems, was often still easier to ask on and easier to get answers on without needing an intellectual charade and without some genius not reading the post, closing it and linking to a similar sounding title despite the content being very different. Which is the crux of the issue; you can't ask questions on SO. Or rather,\nyou\ncan't ask questions. No, no, that's not enough. You'll have to engage with the community, answer many other questions first, ensure that your account has enough \"clout\" to overturn stupid closures of questions, and when you have wasted enough time doing that, then you can finally ask your own question. Or you can just go somewhere else that isn't an intellectual charade and circle jerking and figure it out without wasting tons of time chasing clout and hoping a moderator won't just close the question as duplicate.

          "text": "As an early user of SO [1], I feel reasonably qualified to discuss this issue. Note that I barely posted after 2011 or so so I can't really speak to the current state.\nBut what I can say is that even back in 2010 it was obvious to me that moderation was a problem, specifically a cultural problem. I'm really talking about the rise of the administrative/bureaucratic class that, if left unchecked, can become absolute poison.\nI'm constantly reminded of the Leonard Nimoy voiced line from Civ4: \"the bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy\". That sums it up exactly. There is a certain type of person who doesn't become a creator of content but rather a moderator of content. These are people who end up as Reddit mods, for example.\nRules and standards are good up to a point but some people forget that those rules and standards serve a purpose and should never become a goal unto themselves. So if the moderators run wild, they'll start creating work for themselves and having debates about what's a repeated question, how questions and answers should be structured, etc.\nThis manifested as the war of \"closed, non-constructive\" on SO. Some really good questions were killed this way because the moderators decided on their own that a question had to have a provable answer to avoid flame wars. And this goes back to the rules and standards being a tool not a goal. My stance was (and is) that shouldn't we solve flame wars when they happen rather than going around and \"solving\" imaginary problems?\nI lost that battle. You can argue taht questions like \"should I use Javascript or Typescript?\" don't belong on SO (as the moderators did). My position was that even though there's no definite answer, somebody can give you a list of strengths and weaknesses and things to consider.\nEven something that does have a definite answer like \"how do I efficiently code a factorial function?\" has multiple but different defensible answers. Even in one language you can have multiple implementations that might, say, be compile-time or runtime.\nAnother commenter here talked about finding the nearest point on an ellipse and came up with a method they're proud of where there are other methods that would also do the job.\nAnyway, I'd occasionally login and see a constant churn on my answers from moderators doing pointless busywork as this month they'd decided something needed to be capitalized or not capitalized.\nA perfect example of this kind of thing is Bryan Henderson's war on \"comprised of\" on Wikipedia [2].\nAnyway, I think the core issue of SO was that there was a lot of low-hanging fruit and I got a lot of accepted answers on questions that could never be asked today. You'll also read many anecdotes about people having a negative experience asking questions on SO in later years where their question was immediately closed as, say, a duplicate when the question wasn't a duplicate. The moderator just didn't understand the difference. That sort of thing.\nBut any mature site ultimately ends with an impossible barrier to entry as newcomers don't know all the cultural rules that have been put in place and they tend to have a negative experience as they get yelled at for not knowing that Rule 11.6.2.7 forbids the kind of question they asked.\n[1]:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/users/18393/cletus\n[2]:\nhttps://www.npr.org/2015/03/12/392568604/dont-you-dare-use-c...",

There's a gondola that takes you to the top on the other side, but you arrange hikes for people that like hiking. You get a group of tourists and they're all ready to hike. Then before you set off you ask the question \"so, what brings you hiking today\" and someone from the group says \"I want to get to the top of the mountain and see the sights, I hate hiking but it is what it is\". And then you say \"if you take a 15 minute drive through the mountain there's a gondola on the other side\". And the person thanks you and goes on their way because they didn't know there was a gondola. They just assumed hiking was the only way up. You would have been happy hiking them up the mountain but by asking the question you realised that they didn't know there was an easier way up.\nIt just goes back to first principles.\nThe truth is sometimes people decide what the solution looks like and then ask for help implementing that solution.

Use LLMs to get public-facing answers, and the community can fix things up.\nNo over-moderation for \"duplicates\" or other SO heavy-handed moderation memes.\nSomeone could ask a question, an LLM could take a first stab at an answer. The author could correct it or ask further questions, and then the community could fill in when it goes off the rails or can't answer.\nYou would be able to see which questions were too long-tail or difficult for the AI to answer, and humans could jump in to patch things up. This could be gamified with points.\nThis would serve as fantastic LLM training material for local LLMs. The authors of the site could put in a clause saying that \"training is allowed as long as you publish your weights + model\".\nSomeone please build this.\nEdit: Removed \"LLMs did not kill Stack Overflow.\" first sentence as suggested.

The community became toxic, so I took my question to other platforms like Reddit (they became toxic as well) and elsewhere.\nMind you, while I'm a relative nobody in terms of open source, I've written everything from emulators and game engines in C++ to enterprise apps in PHP, Java, Ruby, etc.\nThe consistent issues I've encountered are holes in documentation, specifically related to undocumented behavior, and in the few cases I've asked about this on SO, I received either no response and downvotes, or negative responses dismissing my questions and downvotes. Early on I thought it was me. What I found out was that it wasn't. Due to the toxic responses, I wasn't about to contribute back, so I just stopped contributing, and only clicked on an SO result if it popped up on Google, and hit the back button if folks were super negative and didn't answer the question.\nLater on, most of my answers actually have come from Github,and 95% of the time, my issues were legitimate ones that would've been mentioned if a decent number of folks used the framework, library, or language in question.\nI think the tl;dr of this is this: If you can't provide a positive contribution on ANY social media platform like Stack Overflow, Reddit, Github, etc. Don't speak. Don't vote. Ignore the question. If you happen to know, help out! Contribute! Write documentation! I've done so on more than one occasion (I even built a website around it and made money in the process due to ignorance elsewhere, until I shut it down due to nearly dying), and in every instance I did so, folks were thankful, and it made me thankful that I was able to help them. (the money wasn't a factor in the website I built, I just wanted to help folks that got stuck in the documentation hole I mentioned)\nEDIT: because I know a bunch of you folks read Ars Technica and certain other sites. I'll help you out: If you find yourself saying that you are being \"pedantic\", you are the problem, not the solution. Nitpicking doesn't solve problems, it just dilutes the problem and makes it bigger. If you can't help, think 3 times and also again don't say anything if your advice isn't helpful.",

When you have a library of every question asked, at some point, you asked most of the easy questions. Have a novel question becomes hard.\n- This graph is using the Posts table, not PostsWithDeleted. So, it only tells you of the questions that survived at this point in time, this [0] is the actual graph which while describes a curve that shows the same behavior, it's more \"accurate\" of the actual post creation.\n- This is actually a Good Thing™. For years most of the questions went unanswered, non-voted, non-commented, just because there was too many questions happening all the time. So the general trend is not something that the SO community needs to do anything about. Almost 20% of every question asked is marked as duplicate. If people searched... better™ they wouldn't ask as many questions, and so everyone else had more bandwidth to deal with the rest.\n- There has been a shift in help desk style of request, where people starting to prefer discord and such to get answers. This is actually a bad thing because that means that the knowledge isn't public nor indexed by the world. So, information becomes harder to find, and you need to break it free from silos.\n- The site, or more accurately, the library will never die. All the information is published in complete archives that anyone can replicate and restart if the company goes under or goes evil. So, yeah, such concerns, while appreciated, are easily addressed. At worst, you would be losing a month or two of data.\n[0]:\nhttps://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/edit/1926...",

By 2018-2020, it felt like the number of times that someone else had already asked the question had increased to the point that there was no reason to bother asking it. Google also continued to do a better and better job of surfacing the right StackOverflow thread, even if the SO search didn't.\nIn 2012 you might search Google, not find what you needed, go to StackOverflow, search and have no better luck, then make a post (and get flamed for it being a frequently-asked question but you were phrasing yours in a different / incorrect way and didn't find the \"real\" answer).\nIn 2017, you would search Google and the relevant StackOverflow thread would be in the top few results, so you wouldn't need to post and ask.\nIn 2020, Google's \"rich snippets\" were showing you the quick answers in the screen real estate that is now used by the AI Overview answers, and those often times had surfaced some info taken from StackOverflow.\nAnd then, at the very end of 2022, ChatGPT came along and effectively acted as the StackOverflow search that you always wanted - you could phrase your question as poorly as you want, no one would flame you, and you'd get some semblance of the correct answer (at least for simple questions).\nI think StackOverflow was ultimately a victim of it's own success. Most of the questions that would be asked by your normal \"question asker\" type of user were eventually \"solved\" and it was just a matter of how easy it was to find them. Google, ChatGPT, \"AI Overviews\", Claude Code, etc have simply made finding those long-answered questions much easier, as well as answering all of the \"new\" questions that could be posed - and without all of the drama and hassle of dealing with a human-moderated site.",

Sometimes, it’s just easier to ask a human to point you in the right direction.

LLMs never get angry at you, they never complain about incorrect formatting or being too lax in your wording. They have infinite patience for you.

Bad questions and tough answer competition is part of it, but moderation was more important, I think. Because in the end what kept SO relevant was that people made their own questions on up to date topics.\nUp until mid-2010s you could make a seriously vague question, and it would be answered, satisfactory or not. (2018 was when I made the last such question. YMMV) After that, almost everything, that hadn't snap-on code answer, was labelled as offtopic or duplicate, and closed, no matter what. (Couple of times I got very rude moderators' comments on the tickets.)\nI think this lead some communities to avoid this moderator hell and start their own forums, where you could afford civilized discussion. Discourse is actually very handy for this (Ironically, it was made by the same devs that created SO). Forums of the earlier generation, have too many bells and whistles, and outdated UI. Discourse has much less friction.\nThen, as more quality material was accumulated elsewhere, newbies stopped seeing SO on top of search, and gradually language/library communities churned off one by one.

Honestly, I don't think that's a huge loss for the knowledge base.\nThe other thing I've noticed lately is a strong push to get non-programming questions off StackOverflow, and on to other sites like SuperUser, ServerFault, DevOps, etc.\nUnfortunately, what's left is so small I don't think there's enough to sustain a community. Without questions to answer, contributors providing the answers disappear, leaving the few questions there often unanswered.",

I spent far much time on that site in the early days, but through it, I also thoroughly enjoyed helping others. I also started to publish articles on CodeProject and it kicked off my long tech blogging “career”, and I still enjoy writing and sharing knowledge with others.\nI have visited the site maybe once a year since 2017. It got to the point that trying to post questions was intolerable, since they always got closed. At this point I have given up on it as a resource, even though it helped me tremendously to both learn (to answer questions) and solve challenging problems, and get help for edge cases, especially on niche topics. For me it is a part of my legacy as a developer for over 30 years.\nI find it deeply saddening to see what it has become. However I think Joel and his team can be proud of what they built and what they gave to the developer community for so many years.\nAs a side note it used to state that was in the top 2% of users on SO, but this metric seems to have been removed. Maybe it’s just because I’m on mobile that I can’t see it any more.\nLLM’s can easily solve those easy problems that have high commonality across many codebases, but I am dubious that they will be able to solve the niche challenging problems that have not been solved before nor written about. I do wonder how those problems get solved in the future.",

Getting to a high-quality question/response required a back-and-forth that the platform made difficult by burying the discovery/definition work in comments and edits instead of a clear discussion mechanism.\nAll of this meant the learning-curve on how to participate was high, and this spurred gate-keeping and over-zealous moderation. High-quality but out-of-date information was preferred over lower-quality but more recent updates. When combined with the rapid shifts brought on with mobile development and web frameworks, the answers could easily get out-of-date months after being answered.\nI remember a time when StackOverflow dominated every search query.

I don't have that kind of connections and all online communities are full of people whose skill is below mine, so it makes little sense to ask something. I still do sometimes, but rarely receive competent answer.\nIf you have some focused topic like a question about small program, of course you can just use github issues or email author directly. But if you have some open question, probably SO is the only generic platform out there.\nTo put it differently, find some experts and ask which online place to the visit to help strangers. Most likely they just don't do it.\nSo for me, personally, LLMs are the saviour. With enough forth and back I can research any topic that doesn't require very deep expertise. Sure, access to an actual expert willing to guide me would be better, but I just don't have that luxury.",

As a result, answers from genuine users that recommended commercial solutions based on personal experience were frequently removed altogether.\nAdditionally, the platform suffers from a lack of centralized authentication: each Stack Exchange subdomain still operates with its own isolated login system, which creates unnecessary friction and discourages broader user participation.",

          "text": "Programming is a ton of fun. There are competing concerns though.\nI recently wrote a 17x3 reed-solomon encoder which is substantially faster on my 10yo laptop than the latest and greatest solution from Backblaze on their fancy schmancy servers. The fun parts for me were:\n1. Finally learning how RS works\n2. Diving in sufficiently far to figure out how to apply tricks like the AVX2 16-element LUT instruction\n3. Having a working, provably better solution\nThe programming between (2) and (3) was ... fine ... but I have literally hundreds of other projects I've never shipped because the problem solving process is more enjoyable and/or more rewarding. If AI were good enough yet to write that code for me then I absolutely would have used it to have more time to focus on the fun bits.\nIt's not that I don't enjoy coding -- some of those other unshipped projects are compilers, tensor frameworks, and other things which exist purely for the benefit of programmer ergonomics. It's just that coding isn't the _only_ thing I enjoy, and it often takes a back seat.\nI most often see people with (what I can read into) your perspective when they \"think\" by programming. They need to be able to probe the existing structure and inject their ideas into the solution space to come up with something satisfactory.\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with that (apologies if I'm assuming to much about the way you work), but some people work differently.\nI personally tend to prefer working through the hard problems in a notebook. By the time the problem is solved, its ideal form in code is obvious. An LLM capable of turning that obvious description into working code is a game changer (it still only works like 30% of the time, and even then only with a lot of heavy lifting from prompt/context/agent structure, so it's not quite a game changer yet, but it has potential).",

          "text": "I enjoy the programming, and the problem solving, but only sometimes the typing. Advent of Code last month was fun to do in Common Lisp, I typed everything but two functions myself, and only consulted with the subreddit and/or the AI on a couple problems. (Those two functions were for my own idea of using A-star over Morton Numbers, I wrote about those numbers with some python code in 2011 and didn't feel like writing the conversion functions again. It didn't work out anyway, I had to get the hint of \"linear programming\" and a pointer to GLPK, which I hadn't used before, so I had the AI teach me how to use it for standard sorts of LP/MIP problems, and then I wrote my own Lisp code to create .lp files corresponding to the Advent problem and had GLPK execute and give the answers.)\nIf it's a language I don't particularly enjoy, though, so much the better that the AI types more of it than me. Today I decided to fix a dumb youtube behavior that has been bugging me for a while, I figured it would be a simple matter of making a Greasemonkey script that does a fetch() request formed from dynamic page data, grabs out some text from the response, and replaces some other text with that. After validating the fetch() part in the console, I told ChatGTP to code it up and also make sure to cache the results. Out comes a nice little 80 lines or so of JS similar to how I would have written it setting up the MutationObserver and handling the cache map and a promises map. It works except in one case where it just needs to wait longer before setting things up, so I have it write that setTimeout loop part too, another several lines, and now it's all working. I still feel a little bit of accomplishment because my problem has been solved (until youtube breaks things again anyway), the core code flow idea I had in mind worked (no need for API shenanigans), and I didn't have to type much JavaScript. It's almost like using a much higher level language. Life is too short to write much code in x86 assembly, or JavaScript for that matter, and I've already written enough of the latter that I feel like I'm good.",

Sometimes you want some background for some color in a slide. Sometimes you want a thing you like in a different style[1]. And don't get me wrong, if you're able to hire an artist for it, and you want to, you absolutely should. But there's nothing wrong IMO with using a machine to do it for you either. You can hand cut dove tails for your drawers with a little practice, and I've done it. I'm also not going to judge someone for using a jig, or buying a pre-cut drawer. You can hand make ravioli with a flour, egg and a rolling pin. I've done it. It was incredible fresh pasta. It was also a ridiculous amount of work and I'm just as happy to buy pre-made ravioli from the store, or roll out the sheets with a pasta machine.\n[1]:\nhttps://www.inprnt.com/gallery/canadianturtle/pacman-ukiyoe/",

LLMs can probably generate an ok project plan for straightforward projects with plenty of examples to be trained on. But perhaps the most important value of generating a plan is the thinking that goes into it. Considering alternatives, likely failures, unlikely failures, etc. In generating the plan you are starting to practice dealing with problem that would come up while implementing it. The knowledge in your head is more valuable than the document produced. The document is just a summary of all the thinking you have done. Essentially a collection of mnemonics.

A Life Fitness Synergy system is also much more practical to own inside of one's house than a power rack and 1000+ lb of plates that will make quick work of most home flooring.\nThis strategy works. It's sure as shit better than doing nothing. But quadriceps, delts and lats don't work in isolation. They rely on secondary and tertiary muscles and entire kinetic chains to help them accomplish tasks.\nCables do hit muscle groups directly, but they also lead to diminishing strength and physique returns much more quickly than boring traditional weight training. They also lead to problematic muscle imbalances that, ironically, can cause overuse injuries later in life (super heavy leg extensions with improper knee flexion comes to mind).",

In a way, I think it’ll make it even easier to stand out\nI totally disagree with this point. It's a combination of wishful thinking and denial. LLMs do a very fine job at writing if you give them the right base of information/insights. I think it will totally obliterate 'writing' as a differentiable skill.\nWhat will happen IMO is that people who have interesting ideas and experiences but suck at writing will have the upper hand. The market for content will be flooded by articles from people who would normally not write. They will feed the LLMs bullet points of interesting facts and observations and let the LLM fill in the gaps and actually make the article engaging. What matters is that the core points have to be interesting. The AI cannot come up with brilliant insights but it can convey brilliant insights really well.\nI think even if, hypothetically, some people could tell apart AI-generated content from manually written content, some AI-generated content may actually be more interesting and valuable to read than the manually written one...\nAt the end of the day, writing by itself doesn't matter; it's just a communication medium. What matters are insights, ideas, concepts, perspectives... It was always about substance, not form. It's a flaw of the human mind that some people used form as a proxy for substance.\nThere are a lot of people who know a lot and have a lot to say but they were so busy experiencing and learning that they never had time to write before... And even if they did, they could not convey their ideas effectively before.\nNow given that LLMs have mastered the superficial aspects of communication, those aspects are no longer valuable and substance is more valuable. But IMO nobody will care whether articles or books were written by AI in the future. It won't have much effect on quality or value of the book/article.\nI think what will matter in the future are:\n- Insights, ideas, perspectives.\n- Media (the most important still); who intermediates content distribution gets to decide what people consume and can shape their perception of quality to a significant extent.\nI'm hoping that as more people get involved in writing using LLMs, that it will force more people to confront the second point... People will be forced to pay more attention to substance as it will be the only real differentiator. I'm hoping people will begin to feel disgusted by the low level of substance that current media platforms purvey... It's already kind of happening; people invented the term \"AI slop\" but really it's not just AI which produces slop. The media has been guilty of spreading slop for quite some time and it kept getting worse. Now AI is just a convenient strawman to bash.",

      "content": "On a catchup call, I told my friend\nNick Wignall\nhow someone had trained an AI model to write blog posts in my style. It was a pure research exercise on their part. The idea was to train the tool on my past work, then give it the headlines and opening paragraphs of my 2025 posts. Could it generate the rest of each piece in a similar fashion?\nI only compared a handful of posts from their AI versions to their originals, but I quickly concluded the writing suffered from the same\nuncanny valley effect\nas many AI-generated images: It all looks fine enough at first glance, but pay attention just a little longer, and something feels off. The AI would veer off in a different direction or end up making the opposite argument. It sounded confident where I would have been doubtful and vice versa. And so on.\nThe creator wanted to know if such a model—once it worked properly, of course—could be useful to me. I told him even if it worked perfectly it wouldn’t. Why? Because I don’t write a daily blog to crank out a post every day. If that was the point, I’d have switched to AI long ago already. I write a daily blog to\nmake sure I remember how to think\n. It’s a daily practice for my brain. A creative ritual to strengthen my writing muscles. And a commitment to my readers. A promise that I’ll show up for them once a day. AI can generate output, but it can’t give me any of these benefits. The output is secondary. If it happens to attract new readers, all the better. And if not? That’s fine too.\nNick said my story reminded him of\nan interview\nwith writer and Vox-founder Ezra Klein. Klein explained that, so far, AI hasn’t been all that useful to him. He uses it for light research or to structure some data, but that’s about it. Why? Because the writer doing the research is what makes the writing unique.\nWhen you’re using AI as a writer, you’re “outsourcing the part of the work [you] need to do the most,” Klein believes. “Having AI summarize a book or a paper for me is a disaster. It has no idea what I really wanted to know. It would not have made the connections I would have made.” This is why\nreading actual books in full might now be more valuable than it ever has been\n: Only if you’ve seen every word will you discover insights and links an AI would never include in its average-driven summary.\nNick pointed out the same applies to a writer struggling when creating a piece. “When you’re stuck and sit there, thinking, trying to come up with what’s next, that’s the valuable part of writing. It’s tempting to use AI to remove that stuck-ness, but it’s basically cheating—and leads to a very different result.” AI is great at giving you a list of ideas. You’ll almost always find one you can plug in and keep writing. But is it\nthe\nidea that needs to slot into this gap? Or just a bad piece of filler that’ll make for a fragile mental bridge most readers won’t dare to cross?\nThe more I think about it, the happier I am that AI is transforming the world of writing. In a way, I think it’ll make it even easier to stand out—because the more people take shortcuts, the less quality will remain for readers to flock to, even if the overall quantity of options is much larger.\nWhenever technology makes it feel like you can avoid the suck, it’s most likely a mirage. The path behind easy only leads to the lowest common denominator. The real artists, fighters, makers—they stick with a truth as old as time itself: The suck is why we’re here, and only those who overcome it themselves will\nreap all the rewards\nof their hard labor.\nNik\nNiklas Göke writes for dreamers, doers, and unbroken optimists. A self-taught writer with more than a decade of experience, Nik has published over 2,000 articles. His work has attracted tens of millions of readers and been featured in places like Business Insider, CNBC, Lifehacker, and many others.\r\n\r\nNik has self-published 2 books thus far, most recently 2-Minute Pep Talks.

      "content": "With 2025 wrapped up, I can finally answer a question I’m curious about every year: who were\nthe most popular bloggers of Hacker News\n?\nWho counts as a blogger?\nI explain more in\nmy methodology page\n, but it’s basically anyone who blogs as an individual rather than as part of a company or a team. For example,\nJohn Graham-Cumming\nblogged while he was the CTO of Cloudflare, so I count his\npersonal blog\nbut not\nhis posts to the Cloudflare company blog\n.\n#1\nSimon Willison\n🔗\nFor the third straight year, Simon Willison was the most popular blogger on Hacker News.\nAt first, Simon’s position at #1 feels obvious: he wrote about AI in a year when everyone’s obsessed with AI. But there are tons of AI bloggers, and Simon is the only one who’s popular on HN, so what sets Simon apart?\nFirst, Simon isn’t selling you anything. Simon writes about LLMs as a power user not as a sales pitch from some startup’s VP of product. He tries every AI tool he can get his hands on with no allegiance to any particular vendor. That allows him to write about how new AI tools fit into the ecosystem at large. It’s like getting restaurant recommendations from someone who eats out 20 times a week as opposed to someone who owns 20 restaurant chains.\nSimon is also one of the most prolific bloggers on Hacker News. In 2025 alone, he wrote over 1,000 blog posts, though only 118 were full-length articles (“only”).\nSimon often finds ideas within walled-garden platforms (e.g., TikTok, Twitter) and simply brings them to the open web, where it’s easier for HN to discuss. Some of his most popular posts were just short quotes or links with a bit of commentary.\n“I’m worried that they put co-pilot in Excel”\nis just a quote from a video he watched on TikTok.\n“A computer can never be held accountable”\nis Simon summarizing a few tweets.\nSimon has said these types of posts are easy to write yet high in value.\nSharing interesting links with commentary is a low effort, high value way to contribute to internet life at large.\n—Simon Willison, “\nMy approach to running a link blog\n”\n#2\nJeff Geerling\n🔗\nThis is Jeff’s most successful year on Hacker News, beating his\n#5 finish in 2023\n.\nThe #2 spot was an extremely tight race this year. Jeff’s posts totaled 10,813 upvotes, edging out the #3 blogger by just 9 points (a 0.08% difference). The #4 finisher was just 100 points behind that. Past stories can still accrue upvotes, so this could still flip, but these were the rankings as of midnight on Dec. 31st.\nJeff is a popular YouTube creator with over 1M subscribers. He covers some of HN’s favorite topics, like Raspberry Pi computers, self-hosted software, and computer hardware. YouTube videos rarely succeed on Hacker News, so when Jeff publishes a new video, he often publishes an accompanying blog post. Jeff isn’t the only YouTuber who does this, but he’s one of the few who does it\nwell\n.\nI’ve seen other YouTube creators try to repurpose their videos by auto-generating a transcript and calling that a blog post. Jeff approaches his blog more thoughtfully.\nJeff started out as a blogger, and he still treats his blog readers as first-class citizens. He structures his articles to fit the text medium rather than just lazily scraping dialog from his videos. If you read his post about\nupgrading storage on his Mac mini\n, it stands on its own and never feels like material he salvaged from a video.\n#3\nSean Goedecke\n🔗\nSean came out of nowhere as a blogging powerhouse this year. He’d been blogging sporadically since 2020, but he hit a turning point at the end of 2024 with\n“How I ship projects at big tech companies.”\nIt was one of HN’s top 100 posts of the year and remains\nSean’s most popular post on HN\n.\nAfter his first success on HN, Sean went from publishing every few months to multiple times per week, becoming a regular fixture on the front page.\nSean is a Staff Software Engineer at GitHub and previously worked at Zendesk. Like Simon, Sean is extremely prolific. He wrote 140 posts this year. Of those, 47 reached the front page. I’ve had a few years where a lot of my posts reached the front page, but for me that was\nabout 10 articles\n. I can’t imagine what it’s like to have a new article on HN almost every week.\nSean explains his strategy in\n“Writing a tech blog people want to read”\n:\nthe recipe for a popular post is to have a clear opinion about working in tech that many people disagree with.\nI think Sean’s insight is true, but he’s selling his own writing a bit short. To me, Sean’s greatest strength is his ability to explain big tech organizational politics to engineers.\nMost junior to mid-level developers don’t care about company politics. They think of office politics as something that strong technical thinkers shouldn’t have to waste brain cells on. As a result, they can’t understand why\nthey can’t get promoted\nor how\ntheir company’s codebase got so bad\n. Sean’s posts explain these phenomena in a way that’s clear and intelligible to engineers.\nSean’s posts are also a good exampl",

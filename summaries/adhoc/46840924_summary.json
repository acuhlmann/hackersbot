        "text": ">\nThat means the article contained a plausible-sounding sentence, cited to a real, relevant-sounding source. But when you read the source it’s cited to, the information on Wikipedia does not exist in that specific source. When a claim fails verification, it’s impossible to tell whether the information is true or not.\nThis has been a rampant problem on Wikipedia always. I can't seem to find any indicator that this has increased recently? Because they're only even investigating articles flagged as potentially AI. So what's the control baseline rate here?\nApplying correct citations is actually really hard work, even when you know the material thoroughly. I just assume people write stuff they know from their field, then mostly look to add the minimum number of plausible citations after the fact, and then most people never check them, and everyone seems to just accept it's better than nothing. But I also suppose it depends on how niche the page is, and which field it's in.",

        "text": "A common source of error is in articles for movies where it gives plot summaries. The plot summaries are very often written by people who didn't watch the movie but are trying to re-resemble the plot like a jigsaw puzzle from little bits they glean from written reviews, or worse just writing down whatever they assume to be the plot. Very often it seems like the fuck ups came from people who either weren't watching the movie carefully, or were just listening to the dialogue while not watching the screen, or simply lacked media literacy.\nExample [SPOILERS]: the page for the movie Sorcerer claims that rough terrain caused a tire to pop. The movie never says that, the movie shows the tire popping (which results in the trucks cargo detonating). The next scene reveals the cause, but only to those paying attention; the bloody corpse of a bandito laying next to a submachine gun is shown in the rubble beside the road, and more banditos are there, very upset and quite nervous, to hijack the second truck. The obvious inference is that the first truck's tire was shot by the bandit to hijack/rob the truck. The tire didn't pop from rough terrain, the movie never says it did, it's just a conclusion you could get from not paying attention to the movie.",

Like, if there's a particular theorem then sure you cite who came up with it, or the main graduate-level textbook it's taught in. But often it's just a particular technique or fact that just kind of \"exists\" in tons of places but there's no obvious\nsingle\nplace to cite it from.\nSo it actually takes some work to find a\ngood\nreference. Like you say, review articles can be a good source, survey articles or books. But it can take a surprising amount of effort to track down a place that actually says the exact thing. I literally just last week was helping a professor (leader in their field!) try to find a citation during peer review for their paper for an \"obvious fact\" in the field, that was in their introduction section. It was actually really challenging, like trying to produce a citation for \"the sky is blue\".\nI remember, years ago, creating a Wikipedia article for a particular type of food in a particular country. You can buy it at literally every supermarket there. How the heck do you\ncite\nthe food and facts about it? It just...\nis\n. Like... websites for manufacturers of the food aren't really citations.

As many people have begun using generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude in their daily lives, it’s unsurprising that people will also consider using them to help draft contributions to Wikipedia. Since Wiki Education’s programs provide a cohort of content contributors whose work we can evaluate, we’ve looked into how our participants are using GenAI tools.\nWe are choosing to share our perspective through this blog post because we hope it will help inform discussions of GenAI-created content on Wikipedia. In an open environment like the Wikimedia movement, it’s important to share what you’ve learned. In this case, we believe our learnings can help Wikipedia editors who are trying to protect the integrity of content on the encyclopedia, Wikipedians who may be interested in using generative AI tools themselves, other program leaders globally who are trying to onboard new contributors who may be interested in using these tools, and the Wikimedia Foundation, whose product and technology team builds software to help support the development of high-quality content on Wikipedia.\nOur fundamental conclusion about generative AI is: Wikipedia editors should never copy and paste the output from generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT into Wikipedia articles.\nLet me explain more.\nAI detection and investigation\nSince the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, we’ve been paying close attention to GenAI-created content, and how it relates to Wikipedia. We’ve spot-checked work of new editors from our programs, primarily focusing on citations to ensure they were real and not hallucinated. We experimented with tools ourselves, we led video sessions about GenAI for our program participants, and we closely tracked\non-wiki policy discussions around GenAI\n. Currently, English Wikipedia prohibits the use of generative AI to create images or in talk page discussions, and recently adopted a\nguideline against using large language models to generate new articles\n.\nAs our Wiki Experts Brianda Felix and Ian Ramjohn worked with program participants throughout the first half of 2025, they found more and more text bearing the hallmarks of generative AI in article content, like bolded words or bulleted lists in odd places. But the use of generative AI wasn’t necessarily problematic, as long as the content was accurate. Wikipedia’s open editing process encourages stylistic revisions to factual text to better fit Wikipedia’s style.\nBut\nwas\nthe text factually accurate? This fundamental question led our Chief Technology Officer, Sage Ross, to investigate different generative AI detectors. He landed on a tool called\nPangram\n, which we have found to be highly accurate for Wikipedia text. Sage generated a list of all the new articles created through our work since 2022, and ran them all through Pangram. A total of 178 out of the 3,078 articles came back as flagged for AI — none before the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, with increasing percentages term over term since then. About half of our staff spent a month during summer 2025 painstakingly reviewing the text from these 178 articles.\nPangram’s detection results showed no signs of AI usage before the launch of ChatGPT, and then a steady rise in usage in the terms following.

The rest had information cited to real, relevant sources.\nFar more insidious, however, was something else we discovered:\nMore than two-thirds of these articles failed verification.\nThat means the article contained a plausible-sounding sentence, cited to a real, relevant-sounding source. But when you read the source it’s cited to, the information on Wikipedia does not exist in that specific source. When a claim fails verification, it’s impossible to tell whether the information is true or not. For most of the articles Pangram flagged as written by GenAI, nearly every cited sentence in the article failed verification.\nThis finding led us to invest significant staff time into cleaning up these articles — far more than these editors had likely spent creating them. Wiki Education’s core mission is to improve Wikipedia, and when we discover our program has unknowingly contributed to misinformation on Wikipedia, we are committed to cleaning it up.

    "article_summary": "Wiki Education's 2025 findings on generative AI and Wikipedia editing conclude that editors should never copy-paste AI chatbot output directly into articles. While AI use isn't inherently problematic if content is accurate, the organization observed AI-generated text with odd formatting in contributions. They emphasize verifying citations to avoid AI \"hallucinations\" and note English Wikipedia's existing prohibitions on AI for images, talk pages, and generating new articles. Their insights aim to help editors protect content integrity and guide new contributors.",
    "comment_summary": "The discussion centers on widespread citation issues on Wikipedia, where sources often don't support the claims they're attached to, making verification impossible. Commenters note this problem long predates AI, arising from both human error and bad-faith editing. While AI-generated content can produce unsubstantiated claims faster, the core issue is a systemic lack of source verification by editors. The conversation references a specific study finding most AI-flagged articles failed verification, but cautions this study focused only on edits from an educational program. Overall, the consensus is that readers must verify sources themselves, as incorrect citations mislead about Wikipedia's accuracy.",

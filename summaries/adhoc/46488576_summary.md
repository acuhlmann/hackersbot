#### Article Summary

The author reflects on the simpler, more manageable era of early web development (PHP 4, jQuery) when a solo developer could handle an entire project. Today, overwhelming complexity in both frontend and backend domains has made this nearly impossible. However, the advent of AI coding assistants (like Claude and Codex) has dramatically leveled the playing field. By leveraging AI and his decades of pattern recognition from working with experts, the author can now efficiently manage the full stack again, achieving a massive productivity boost and regaining the ability to confidently go from idea to execution.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The text discusses how AI coding assistants are enabling people with prior coding experience—especially those who moved to management or became parents—to resume side projects by reducing the time and effort needed to start or update code. Supporters highlight increased productivity, lower decision fatigue, and the ability to quickly overcome knowledge gaps or outdated skills. Critics argue it risks promoting shallow engagement, management overreach into production code, and a loss of deeper programming enjoyment. Overall, AI is seen as a tool that lowers barriers to coding but raises questions about code quality and the nature of programming work.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 🤔 MIXED (score: 0.65)

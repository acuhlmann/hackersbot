*The article title and content explicitly discuss 'generative AI' and its impacts on Wikipedia editing, directly referencing AI technology.*

#### Article Summary

Wiki Education's 2025 findings on generative AI and Wikipedia editing conclude that editors should never copy-paste AI chatbot output directly into articles. While AI use isn't inherently problematic if content is accurate, the organization observed AI-generated text with odd formatting in contributions. They emphasize verifying citations to avoid AI "hallucinations" and note English Wikipedia's existing prohibitions on AI for images, talk pages, and generating new articles. Their insights aim to help editors protect content integrity and guide new contributors.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The discussion centers on widespread citation issues on Wikipedia, where sources often don't support the claims they're attached to, making verification impossible. Commenters note this problem long predates AI, arising from both human error and bad-faith editing. While AI-generated content can produce unsubstantiated claims faster, the core issue is a systemic lack of source verification by editors. The conversation references a specific study finding most AI-flagged articles failed verification, but cautions this study focused only on edits from an educational program. Overall, the consensus is that readers must verify sources themselves, as incorrect citations mislead about Wikipedia's accuracy.

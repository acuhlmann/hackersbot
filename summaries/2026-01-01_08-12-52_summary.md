**Points:** 440 | **Author:** azhenley | **Time:** 2025-12-31T18:26:32 1767205592 | **Comments:** 255

#### Article Summary

The author canceled a book deal with a major publisher after initially signing on. He was drawn by the publisher's support and credibility but ultimately reconsidered due to significant downsides: low pay, loss of creative control, minimal marketing, and the publisher's ability to discontinue the book. His planned book would compile tutorials on classic, enduring programming projects, based on his popular blog posts. Instead, he chose to self-publish, releasing the ebook chapter-by-chapter and planning a future print version on Amazon.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

A technical author canceled his book deal, citing publisher pressure to add AI content and creative disagreements. Commenters debate whether the issue was the publisher's demands or the author's missed deadlines. Many support self-publishing, noting traditional publishers often chase trends like AI and offer little financial reward for niche books. Some share positive experiences with publishers, emphasizing the need for self-motivation. Overall, the discussion highlights a publishing industry under financial strain, pushing for marketable topics, while self-publishing is seen as a viable alternative for maintaining creative control.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 🤔 MIXED (score: 0.55)

### 4. Show HN: BusterMQ, Thread-per-core NATS server in Zig with io_uring

**URL:** [https://bustermq.sh/](https://bustermq.sh/)
**Points:** 73 | **Author:** jbaptiste | **Time:** 2026-01-01T00:18:43 1767226723 | **Comments:** 15

#### Article Summary

BusterMQ is an early-stage, thread-per-core NATS server written in Zig, using io_uring for high performance. It aims to maximize hardware bandwidth. Benchmarks on a 16-core AMD Ryzen show it significantly outperforms a Go-based NATS server in a fan-out test, achieving higher publish/delivery rates (up to 6.30M/58.74M msgs/sec), greater bandwidth (up to 8.20 GB/s), and drastically lower tail latency. Key optimizations include busy-poll and shard-aware routing. It is compatible with the existing NATS protocol for core features like pub/sub and wildcards, with more features planned.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The text is a series of comments discussing a technical project. Key points include a user asking about the test hardware and the choice of the Zig programming language, with a reply noting the hardware is standard consumer-grade. Several comments praise the use of the Bazel build system for its monorepo compatibility, while another criticizes it, preferring Zig's native build tool. One comment requests benchmarks. The final comment is highly critical, accusing the project of being low-quality "AI slop" created for resume padding or dubious purposes, noting it even has a custom domain.

##### Comment Sentiment

### 5. Resistance training load does not determine hypertrophy

**URL:** [https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP289684](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP289684)
**Points:** 119 | **Author:** Luc | **Time:** 2025-12-31T22:25:58 1767219958 | **Comments:** 119

#### Article Summary

This study challenges the common belief that heavier resistance training loads are necessary for muscle growth. It finds that hypertrophy can be achieved across a wide spectrum of loads, from light to heavy, provided training is performed to volitional failure. The key mechanism driving muscle growth appears to be the recruitment and fatigue of high-threshold motor units, which can occur regardless of the weight used. Therefore, factors like exercise volume and effort (training to failure) are more critical for hypertrophy than the absolute load itself. This offers flexibility in program design for different populations.

#### Overall Comment Discussion Summary

The discussion critiques a study comparing high-load (8-12 reps) and low-load (20-25 reps) training for muscle growth. Key points include:

- The study suggests that, for untrained individuals, both methods yield similar hypertrophy if sets are taken to muscle failure, with genetics explaining most response variation.
- Critics argue results may not apply to trained individuals, as "newbie gains" occur with any stimulus.
- Several commenters emphasize that effective hypertrophy requires training near failure, but warn against always going to failure due to injury risk, especially in compound lifts.
- Some note that very high reps become cardio, not resistance training, and that strength development requires heavy loads for neurological adaptation.
- Overall, the thread debates the balance of load, volume, and failure in training, highlighting gaps between study populations and practical, long-term training.

##### Comment Sentiment

**Sentiment:** 🤔 MIXED (score: 0.55)

*The comments show a mix of critical skepticism about study methodology and constructive discussion of training principles. While some dismiss the research as flawed or 'gym bro science,' others engage in nuanced debate about hypertrophy, injury risk, and practical application. The overall tone is analytical rather than emotional, with more focus on technical critique than positive endorsement.*

##### Agreement with Article

**Consensus:** 🤷 MIXED (score: 0.40)

*Commenters are divided. Some agree with the article's core premise that load is not the sole determinant of hypertrophy, while many others strongly criticize the study's methodology, particularly its use of untrained subjects, arguing the findings may not apply to experienced lifters.*

**Key Points:**

- Criticism of using untrained subjects ('newbies') and questioning generalizability to experienced lifters
- Support for the idea that effort/training to failure is a key driver of hypertrophy, not just load
- Discussion of study design limitations, like within-subject comparisons and potential carryover effects

##### Main Discussion Topics

- study methodology critique
- hypertrophy training principles
- injury risk in weightlifting
- newbie gains vs. trained individuals
- rep ranges and training intensity
